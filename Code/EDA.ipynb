I got \\noff light. We found my brother frozen at his watch, with a smile on his face.\" \\nSer Waymar shrugged. \"You ought dress more warmly, Gared.\" \\nGared glared at the lordling, the scars around his ear holes flushed red with anger where Maester \\nAemon had cut the ears away. \"We\\'ll see how warm you can dress when the winter comes.\" He pulled \\nup his hood and hunched over his garron, silent and sullen. \\n\"If Gared said it was the cold . . .\" Will began. \\n\"Have you drawn any watches this past week, Will?\" \\n\"Yes, m\\'lord.\" There never was a week when he did not draw a dozen bloody watches. What was the \\nman driving at? \\n\"And how did you find the Wall?\" \\n\"Weeping,\" Will said, frowning. He saw it clear enough, now that the lordling had pointed it out. \"They \\ncouldn\\'t have froze. Not if the Wall was weeping. It wasn\\'t cold enough.\" \\nRoyce nodded. \"Bright lad. We\\'ve had a few light frosts this past week, and a quick flurry of snow now \\nand then, but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight grown men. Men clad in fur and leather, let me \\nremind you, with shelter near at hand, and the means of making fire.\" The knight\\'s smile was cocksure. \\n\"Will, lead us there. I would see these dead men for myself.\" \\nAnd then there was nothing to be done for it. The order had been given, and honor bound them to obey. \\nWill went in front, his shaggy little garron picking the way carefully through the undergrowth. A light \\nsnow had fallen the night before, and there were stones and roots and hidden sinks lying just under its \\ncrust, waiting for the careless and the unwary. Ser Waymar Royce came next, his great black destrier \\nsnorting impatiently. The warhorse was the wrong mount for ranging, but try and tell that to the lordling. \\nGared brought up the rear. The old man-at-arms muttered to himself as he rode. \\nTwilight deepened. The cloudless sky turned a deep purple, the color of an old bruise, then faded to \\nblack. The stars began to come out. A half-moon rose. Will was grateful for the light. \\n\"We can make a better pace than this, surely,\" Royce said when the moon was full risen. \\n\"Not with this horse,\" Will said. Fear had made him insolent. \"Perhaps my lord would care to take the \\nlead?\" \\nSer Waymar Royce did not deign to reply. \\nSomewhere off in the wood a wolf howled. \\nWill pulled his garron over beneath an ancient gnarled ironwood and dismounted. \\n  4\\n\\n\"Why are you stopping?\" Ser Waymar asked. \\n\"Best go the rest of the way on foot, m\\'lord. It\\'s just over that ridge.\" \\nRoyce paused a moment, staring off into the distance, his face reflective. A cold wind whispered through \\nthe trees. His great sable cloak stirred behind like something half-alive. \\n\"There\\'s something wrong here,\" Gared muttered. \\nThe young knight gave him a disdainful smile. \"Is there?\" \\n\"Can\\'t you feel it?\" Gared asked. \"Listen to the darkness.\" \\nWill could feel it. Four years in the Night\\'s Watch, and he had never been so afraid. What was it? \\n\"Wind. Trees rustling. A wolf. Which sound is it that unmans you so, Gared?\" When Gared did not \\nanswer, Royce slid gracefully from his saddle. He tied the destrier securely to a low-hanging limb, well \\naway from the other horses, and drew his longsword from its sheath. Jewels glittered in its hilt, and the \\nmoonlight ran down the shining steel. It was a splendid weapon, castle-forged, and new-made from the \\nlook of it. Will doubted it had ever been swung in anger. \\n\"The trees press close here,\" Will warned. \"That sword will tangle you up, m1ord. Better a knife.\" \\n\"If I need instruction, I will ask for it,\" the young lord said. \"Gared, stay here. Guard the horses.\" \\nGared dismounted. \"We need a fire. I\\'ll see to it.\" \\n\"How big a fool are you, old man? If there are enemies in this wood, a fire is the last thing we want.\" \\n\"There\\'s some enemies a fire will keep away,\" Gared said. \"Bears and direwolves and ... and other \\nthings . . .\" \\nSer Waymar\\'s mouth became a hard line. \"No fire.\" \\nGared\\'s hood shadowed his face, but Will could see the hard glitter in his eyes as he stared at the knight. \\nFor a moment he was afraid the older man would go for his sword. It was a short, ugly thing, its grip \\ndiscolored by sweat, its edge nicked from hard use, but Will would not have given an iron bob for the \\nlordling\\'s life if Gared pulled it from its scabbard. \\nFinally Gared looked down. \"No fire,\" he muttered, low under his breath. \\nRoyce took it for acquiescence and turned away. \"Lead on,\" he said to Will. \\nWill threaded their way through a thicket, then started up the slope to the low ridge where he had found \\nhis vantage point under a sentinel tree. Under the thin crust of snow, the ground was damp and muddy, \\nslick footing, with rocks and hidden roots to trip you up. Will made no sound as he climbed. Behind him, \\nhe heard the soft metallic slither of the lordling\\'s ringmail, the rustle of leaves, and muttered curses as \\nreaching branches grabbed at his longsword and tugged on his splendid sable cloak. \\nThe great sentinel was right there at the top of the ridge, where Will had known it would be, its lowest \\nbranches a bare foot off the ground. Will slid in underneath, flat on his belly in the snow and the mud, and \\n  5\\n\\nlooked down on the empty clearing below. \\nHis heart stopped in his chest. For a moment he dared not breathe. Moonlight shone down on the \\nclearing, the ashes of the firepit, the snow-covered lean-to, the great rock, the little half-frozen stream. \\nEverything was just as it had been a few hours ago. \\nThey were gone. All the bodies were gone. \\n\"Gods!\" he heard behind him. A sword slashed at a branch as Ser Waymar Royce gained the ridge. He \\nstood there beside the sentinel, longsword in hand, his cloak billowing behind him as the wind came up, \\noutlined nobly against the stars for all to see. \\n\"Get down!\" Will whispered urgently. \"Something\\'s wrong.\" \\nRoyce did not move. He looked down at the empty clearing and laughed. \"Your dead men seem to have \\nmoved camp, Will.\" \\nWill\\'s voice abandoned him. He groped for words that did not come. It was not possible. His eyes \\nswept back and forth over the abandoned campsite, stopped on the axe. A huge double-bladed \\nbattle-axe, still lying where he had seen it last, untouched. A valuable weapon . . . \\n\"On your feet, Will,\" Ser Waymar commanded. \"There\\'s no one here. I won\\'t have you hiding under a \\nbush.\" \\nReluctantly, Will obeyed. \\nSer Waymar looked him over with open disapproval. \"I am not going back to Castle Black a failure on \\nmy first ranging. We will find these men.\" He glanced around. \"Up the tree. Be quick about it. Look for a \\nfire.\" \\nWill turned away, wordless. There was no use to argue. The wind was moving. It cut right through him. \\nHe went to the tree, a vaulting grey-green sentinel, and began to climb. Soon his hands were sticky with \\nsap, and he was lost among the needles. Fear filled his gut like a meal he could not digest. He whispered \\na prayer to the nameless gods of the wood, and slipped his dirk free of its sheath. He put it between his \\nteeth to keep both hands free for climbing. The taste of cold iron in his mouth gave him comfort. \\nDown below, the lordling called out suddenly, \"Who goes there?\" Will heard uncertainty in the challenge. \\nHe stopped climbing; he listened; he watched. \\nThe woods gave answer: the rustle of leaves, the icy rush of the stream, a distant hoot of a snow owl. \\nThe Others made no sound. \\nWill saw movement from the corner of his eye. Pale shapes gliding through the wood. He turned his \\nhead, glimpsed a white shadow in the darkness. Then it was gone. Branches stirred gently in the wind, \\nscratching at one another with wooden fingers. Will opened his mouth to call down a warning, and the \\nwords seemed to freeze in his throat. Perhaps he was wrong. Perhaps it had only been a bird, a reflection \\non the snow, some trick of the moonlight. What had he seen, after all? \\n\"Will, where are you?\" Ser Waymar called up. \"Can you see anything?\" He was turning in a slow circle, \\nsuddenly wary, his sword in hand. He must have felt them, as Will felt them. There was nothing to see. \\n  6\\n\\n\"Answer me! Why is it so cold?\" \\nIt was cold. Shivering, Will clung more tightly to his perch. His face pressed hard against the trunk of the \\nsentinel. He could feel the sweet, sticky sap on his cheek. \\nA shadow emerged from the dark of the wood. It stood in front of Royce. Tall, it was, and gaunt and \\nhard as old bones, with flesh pale as milk. Its armor seemed to change color as it moved; here it was \\nwhite as new-fallen snow, there black as shadow, everywhere dappled with the deep grey-green of the \\ntrees. The patterns ran like moonlight on water with every step it took. \\nWill heard the breath go out of Ser Waymar Royce in a long hiss. \\n\"Come no farther,\" the lordling warned. His voice cracked like a boy\\'s. He threw the long sable cloak \\nback over his shoulders, to free his arms for battle, and took his sword in both hands. The wind had \\nstopped. It was very cold. \\nThe Other slid forward on silent feet. In its hand was a longsword like none that Will had ever seen. No \\nhuman metal had gone into the forging of that blade. It was alive with moonlight, translucent, a shard of \\ncrystal so thin that it seemed almost to vanish when seen edge-on. There was a faint blue shimmer to the \\nthing, a ghost-light that played around its edges, and somehow Will knew it was sharper than any razor. \\nSer Waymar met him bravely. \"Dance with me then.\" He lifted his sword high over his head, defiant. His \\nhands trembled from the weight of it, or perhaps from the cold. Yet in that moment, Will thought, he was \\na boy no longer, but a man of the Night\\'s Watch. \\nThe Other halted. Will saw its eyes; blue, deeper and bluer than any human eyes, a blue that burned like \\nice. They fixed on the longsword trembling on high, watched the moonlight running cold along the metal. \\nFor a heartbeat he dared to hope. \\nThey emerged silently from the shadows, twins to the first. Three of them . . . four . . . five . . . Ser \\nWaymar may have felt the cold that came with them, but he never saw them, never heard them. Will had \\nto call out. It was his duty. And his death, if he did. He shivered, and hugged the tree, and kept the \\nsilence. \\nThe pale sword came shivering through the air. \\nSer Waymar met it with steel. When the blades met, there was no ring of metal on metal; only a high, \\nthin sound at the edge of hearing, like an animal screaming in pain. Royce checked a second blow, and a \\nthird, then fell back a step. Another flurry of blows, and he fell back again. \\nBehind him, to right, to left, all around him, the watchers stood patient, faceless, silent, the shifting \\npatterns of their delicate armor making them all but invisible in the wood. Yet they made no move to \\ninterfere. \\nAgain and again the swords met, until Will wanted to cover his ears against the strange anguished \\nkeening of their clash. Ser Waymar was panting from the effort now, his breath steaming in the moonlight. \\nHis blade was white with frost; the Other\\'s danced with pale blue light. \\nThen Royce\\'s parry came a beat too late. The pale sword bit through the ringmail beneath his arm. The \\nyoung lord cried out in pain. Blood welled between the rings. It steamed in the cold, and the droplets \\nseemed red as fire where they touched the snow. Ser \\n  7\\n\\nWaymar\\'s fingers brushed his side. His moleskin glove came away soaked with red. \\nThe Other said something in a language that Will did not know; his voice was like the cracking of ice on \\na winter lake, and the words were mocking. \\nSer Waymar Royce found his fury. \"For Robert!\" he shouted, and he came up snarling, lifting the \\nfrost-covered longsword with both hands and swinging it around in a flat sidearm slash with all his weight \\nbehind it. The Other\\'s parry was almost lazy. \\nWhen the blades touched, the steel shattered. \\nA scream echoed through the forest night, and the longsword shivered into a hundred brittle pieces, the \\nshards scattering like a rain of needles. Royce went to his knees, shrieking, and covered his eyes. Blood \\nwelled between his fingers. \\nThe watchers moved forward together, as if some signal had been given. Swords rose and fell, all in a \\ndeathly silence. It was cold butchery. The pale blades sliced through ringmail as if it were silk. Will closed \\nhis eyes. Far beneath him, he heard their voices and laughter sharp as icicles. \\nWhen he found the courage to look again, a long time had passed, and the ridge below was empty. \\nHe stayed in the tree, scarce daring to breathe, while the moon crept slowly across the black sky. \\nFinally, his muscles cramping and his fingers numb with cold, he climbed down. \\nRoyce\\'s body lay facedown in the snow, one arm outflung. The thick sable cloak had been slashed in a \\ndozen places. Lying dead like that, you saw how young he was. A boy. \\nHe found what was left of the sword a few feet away, the end splintered and twisted like a tree struck \\nby lightning. Will knelt, looked around warily, and snatched it up. The broken sword would be his proof. \\nGared would know what to make of it, and if not him, then surely that old bear Mormont or Maester \\nAemon. Would Gared still be waiting with the horses? He had to hurry. \\nWill rose. Ser Waymar Royce stood over him. \\nHis fine clothes were a tatter, his face a ruin. A shard from his sword transfixed the blind white pupil of \\nhis left eye. \\nThe right eye was open. The pupil burned blue. It saw. \\nThe broken sword fell from nerveless fingers. Will closed his eyes to pray. Long, elegant hands brushed \\nhis cheek, then tightened around his throat. They were gloved in the finest moleskin and sticky with \\nblood, yet the touch was icy cold. \\nBRAN \\nThe morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set \\nforth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with \\nexcitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his \\n  8\\n\\nbrothers to see the king\\'s justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran\\'s life. \\nThe man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he was a wildling, his sword \\nsworn to Mance Rayder, the Kingbeyond-the-Wall. It made Bran\\'s skin prickle to think of it. He \\nremembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them. The wildlings were cruel men, she said, slavers and \\nslayers and thieves. They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and \\ndrank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible \\nhalf-human children. \\nBut the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the king\\'s justice was old and \\nscrawny, not much taller than Robb. He had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite, and he dressed all in \\nblack, the same as a brother of the Night\\'s Watch, except that his furs were ragged and greasy. \\nThe breath of man and horse mingled, steaming, in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut \\ndown from the wall and \\ndragged before them. Robb and Jon sat tall and still on their horses, with Bran between them on his \\npony, trying to seem older than seven, trying to pretend that he\\'d seen all this before. A faint wind blew \\nthrough the holdfast gate. Over their heads flapped the banner of the Starks of Winterfell: a grey direwolf \\nracing across an ice-white field. \\nBran\\'s father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard \\nwas shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes \\nthis day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of \\nthe age of heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father\\'s face, Bran thought, and \\ndonned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell. \\nThere were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning, but afterward Bran could \\nnot recall much of what had been said. Finally his lord father gave a command, and two of his guardsmen \\ndragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square. They forced his head down \\nonto the hard black wood. Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy brought forth \\nthe sword. \"Ice,\" that sword was called. It was as wide across as a man\\'s hand, and taller even than \\nRobb. The blade was Valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as smoke. Nothing held an edge like Valyrian \\nsteel. \\nHis father peeled off his gloves and handed them to Jory Cassel, the captain of his household guard. He \\ntook hold of Ice with both hands and said, \"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of \\nhis Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and \\nProtector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of \\nthe North, I do sentence you to die.\" He lifted the greatsword high above his head. \\nBran\\'s bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. \"Keep the pony well in hand,\" he whispered. \"And \\ndon\\'t look away. Father will know if you do.\" \\nBran kept his pony well in hand, and did not look away. \\nHis father took off the man\\'s head with a single sure stroke. Blood sprayed out across the snow, as red \\nas surnmerwine. One of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting. Bran could not \\ntake his eyes off the blood. The snows around the stump drank it eagerly, reddening as he watched. \\nThe head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy\\'s feet. Theon was a lean, dark \\n  9\\n\\nyouth of nineteen who found \\neverything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head, and kicked it away. \\n\"Ass,\" Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran\\'s shoulder, and Bran \\nlooked over at his bastard brother. \"You did well,\" Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand \\nat justice. \\nIt seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell, though the wind had died by then and the sun was \\nhigher in the sky. Bran rode with his brothers, well ahead of the main party, his pony struggling hard to \\nkeep up with their horses. \\n\"The deserter died bravely,\" Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother\\'s \\ncoloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. \"He had courage, at the \\nleast.\" \\n\"No,\" Jon Snow said quietly. \"It was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his \\neyes, Stark.\" Jon\\'s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not \\nsee. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was \\nmuscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast. \\nRobb was not impressed. \"The Others take his eyes,\" he swore. \"He died well. Race you to the bridge?\" \\n\"Done,\" Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the \\ntrail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of \\nsnow as they went. \\nBran did not try to follow. His pony could not keep up. He had seen the ragged man\\'s eyes, and he was \\nthinking of them now. After a while, the sound of Robb\\'s laughter receded, and the woods grew silent \\nagain. \\nSo deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride \\nbeside him. \"Are you well, Bran?\" he asked, not unkindly. \\n\"Yes, Father,\" Bran told him. He looked up. Wrapped in his furs and leathers, mounted on his great \\nwarhorse, his lord father loomed over him like a giant. \"Robb says the man died bravely, but Jon says he \\nwas afraid.\" \\n\"What do you think?\" his father asked. \\nBran thought about it. \"Can a man still be brave if he\\'s afraid?\" \\n\"That is the only time a man can be brave,\" his father told him. \"Do you understand why I did it?\" \\n\"He was a wildling,\" Bran said. \"They carry off women and sell them to the Others.\" \\nHis lord father smiled. \"Old Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man was an oathbreaker, \\na deserter from the Night\\'s Watch. No man is more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he \\nis taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was \\nnot why the man had to die, but why I must do it.\" \\n  10\\n\\nBran had no answer for that. \"King Robert has a headsman,\" he said, uncertainly. \\n\"He does,\" his father admitted. \"As did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is the older way. \\nThe blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man \\nwho passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man\\'s life, you owe it to him to \\nlook into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does \\nnot deserve to die. \\n\"One day, Bran, you will be Robb\\'s bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your \\nking, and justice will fall to you. When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither \\nmust you look away. A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.\" \\nThat was when Jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them. He waved and shouted down at \\nthem. \"Father, Bran, come quickly, see what Robb has found!\" Then he was gone again. \\nJory rode up beside them. \"Trouble, my lord?\" \\n\"Beyond a doubt,\" his lord father said. \"Come, let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now.\" \\nHe sent his horse into a trot. Jory and Bran and the rest came after. \\nThey found Robb on the riverbank north of the bridge, with Jon still mounted beside him. The late \\nsummer snows had been heavy this moonturn. Robb stood knee-deep in white, his hood pulled back so \\nthe sun shone in his hair. He was cradling something in his arm, while the boys talked in hushed, excited \\nvoices. \\nThe riders picked their way carefully through the drifts, groping for solid footing on the hidden, uneven \\nground. Jory Cassel and Theon Greyjoy were the first to reach the boys. Greyjoy was laughing and \\njoking as he rode. Bran heard the breath go out of him. \"Gods!\" he exclaimed, struggling to keep control \\nof his horse as he reached for his sword. \\nJory\\'s sword was already out. \"Robb, get away from it!\" he called as his horse reared under him. \\nRobb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms. \"She can\\'t hurt you,\" he said. \"She\\'s dead, \\nJory.\" \\nBran was afire with curiosity by then. He would have spurred the pony faster, but his father made them \\ndismount beside the bridge and approach on foot. Bran jumped off and ran. \\nBy then Jon, Jory, and Theon Greyjoy had all dismounted as well. \"What in the seven hells is it?\" \\nGreyjoy was saying. \\n\"A wolf,\" Robb told him. \\n\"A freak,\" Greyjoy said. \"Look at the size of it.\" \\nBran\\'s heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waist-high drift to his brothers\\' side. \\nHalf-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice had formed in its shaggy \\ngrey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman\\'s perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes \\ncrawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It \\nwas bigger than his pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father\\'s kennel. \\n  11\\n\\n\"It\\'s no freak,\" Jon said calmly. \"That\\'s a direwolf. They grow larger than the other kind.\" \\nTheon Greyjoy said, \"There\\'s not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years.\" \\n\"I see one now,\" Jon replied. \\nBran tore his eyes away from the monster. That was when he noticed the bundle in Robb\\'s arms. He \\ngave a cry of delight and moved closer. The pup was a tiny ball of grey-black fur, its eyes still closed. It \\nnuzzled blindly against Robb\\'s chest as he cradled it, searching for milk among his leathers, making a sad \\nlittle whimpery sound. Bran reached out hesitantly. \"Go on,\" Robb told him. \"You can touch him.\" \\nBran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke, then turned as Jon said, \"Here you go.\" His half brother put a \\nsecond pup into his arms. \"There are five of them.\" Bran sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup \\nto his face. Its fur was soft and warm against his cheek. \\n\"Direwolves loose in the realm, after so many years,\" muttered Hullen, the master of horse. \"I like it not.\" \\n\"It is a sign,\" Jory said. \\nFather frowned. \"This is only a dead animal, Jory,\" he said. Yet he seemed troubled. Snow crunched \\nunder his boots as he moved around the body. \"Do we know what killed her?\" \\n\"There\\'s something in the throat,\" Robb told him, proud to have found the answer before his father even \\nasked. \"There, just under the jaw.,, \\nHis father knelt and groped under the beast\\'s head with his hand. \\nHe gave a yank and held it up for all to see. A foot of shattered antler, tines snapped off, all wet with \\nblood. \\nA sudden silence descended over the party. The men looked at the antler uneasily, and no one dared to \\nspeak. Even Bran could sense their fear, though he did not understand. \\nHis father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow. \"I\\'m surprised she lived long \\nenough to whelp,\" he said. His voice broke the spell. \\n\"Maybe she didn\\'t,\" Jory said. \"I\\'ve heard tales . . . maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups \\ncame.\" \\n\"Born with the dead,\" another man put in. \"Worse luck.\" \\n\"No matter,\" said Hullen. \"They be dead soon enough too.\" \\nBran gave a wordless cry of dismay. \\n\"The sooner the better,\" Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. \"Give the beast here, Bran.\" \\nThe little thing squirmed against him, as if it heard and understood. \"No!\" Bran cried out fiercely. \"It\\'s \\nmine.\" \\n  12\\n\\n\"Put away your sword, Greyjoy,\" Robb said. For a moment he sounded as commanding as their father, \\nlike the lord he would someday be. \"We will keep these pups.\" \\n\"You cannot do that, boy,\" said Harwin, who was Hullen\\'s son. \\n\"It be a mercy to kill them,\" Hullen said. \\nBran looked to his lord father for rescue, but got only a frown, a furrowed brow. \"Hullen speaks truly, \\nson. Better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation.\" \\n\"No!\" He could feel tears welling in his eyes, and he looked away. He did not want to cry in front of his \\nfather. \\nRobb resisted stubbornly. \"Ser Rodrik\\'s red bitch whelped again last week,\" he said. \"It was a small \\nlitter, only two live pups. She\\'ll have milk enough.\" \\n\"She\\'ll rip them apart when they try to nurse.\" \\n\"Lord Stark,\" Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with \\ndesperate hope. \"There are five pups,\" he told Father. \"Three male, two female.\" \\n\"What of it, Jon?\" \\n\"You have five trueborn children,\" Jon said. \"Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your \\nHouse. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.\" \\nBran saw his father\\'s face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart \\nat that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right \\nonly because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, \\nincluded even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom \\ndecreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own. \\nTheir father understood as well. \"You want no pup for yourself, Jon?\" he asked softly. \\n\"The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,\" Jon pointed out. \"I am no Stark, Father.\" \\nTheir lord father regarded Jon thoughtfully. Robb rushed into the silence he left. \"I will nurse him myself, \\nFather,\" he promised. \"I will soak a towel with warm milk, and give him suck from that.\" \\n\"Me too!\" Bran echoed. \\nThe lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes. \"Easy to say, and harder to do. I will not \\nhave you wasting the servants\\' time with this. If you want these pups, you will feed them yourselves. Is \\nthat understood?\" \\nBran nodded eagerly. The pup squirmed in his grasp, licked at his face with a warm tongue. \\n\"You must train them as well,\" their father said. \"You must train them. The kennelmaster will have nothing \\nto do with these monsters, I promise you that. And the gods help you if you neglect them, or brutalize \\nthem, or train them badly. These are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick. A direwolf will rip \\n  13\\n\\na man\\'s arm off his shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat. Are you sure you want this?\" \\n\"Yes, Father,\" Bran said. \\n\"Yes,\" Robb agreed. \\n\"The pups may die anyway, despite all you do.\" \\n\"They won\\'t die,\" Robb said. \"We won\\'t let them die.\" \\n\"Keep them, then. Jory, Desmond, gather up the other pups. It\\'s time we were back to Winterfell.\" \\nIt was not until they were mounted and on their way that Bran allowed himself to taste the sweet air of \\nvictory. By then, his pup was snuggled inside his leathers, warm against him, safe for the long ride home. \\nBran was wondering what to name him. \\nHalfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly. \\n\"What is it, Jon?\" their lord father asked. \\n\"Can\\'t you hear it?\" \\nBran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering \\nof his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else. \\n\"There,\" Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him \\ndismount where the direwolf lay \\ndead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling. \\n\"He must have crawled away from the others,\" Jon said. \\n\"Or been driven away,\" their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the \\nlitter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran \\nthought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind. \\n\"An albino,\" Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. \"This one will die even faster than the others.\" \\nJon Snow gave his father\\'s ward a long, chilling look. \"I think not, Greyjoy,\" he said. \"This one belongs \\nto me.\" \\nCATELYN \\nCatelyn had never liked this godswood. \\nShe had been born a Tully, at Riverrun far to the south, on the Red Fork of the Trident. The godswood \\nthere was a garden, bright and airy, where tall redwoods spread dappled shadows across tinkling \\nstreams, birds sang from hidden nests, and the air was spicy with the scent of flowers. \\n  14\\n\\nThe gods of Winterfell kept a different sort of wood. It was a dark, primal place, three acres of old \\nforest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around it. It smelled of moist earth and \\ndecay. No redwoods grew here. This was a wood of stubborn sentinel trees armored in grey-green \\nneedles, of mighty oaks, of ironwoods as old as the realm itself. Here thick black trunks crowded close \\ntogether while twisted branches wove a dense canopy overhead and misshappen roots wrestled beneath \\nthe soil. This was a place of deep silence and brooding shadows, and the gods who lived here had no \\nnames. \\nBut she knew she would find her husband here tonight. Whenever he took a man\\'s life, afterward he \\nwould seek the quiet of the godswood. \\nCatelyn had been anointed with the seven oils and named in the rainbow of light that filled the sept of \\nRiverrun. She was of the Faith, like her father and grandfather and his father before him. Her gods had \\nnames, and their faces were as familiar as the faces of her parents. \\nWorship was a septon with a censer, the smell of incense, a seven-sided crystal alive with light, voices \\nraised in song. The Tullys kept a godswood, as all the great houses did, but it was only a place to walk \\nor read or lie in the sun. Worship was for the sept. \\nFor her sake, Ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven faces of god, but the blood of \\nthe First Men still flowed in the veins of the Starks, and his own gods were the old ones, the nameless, \\nfaceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the vanished children of the forest. \\nAt the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black \\nand cold. \"The heart tree,\" Ned called it. The weirwood\\'s bark was white as bone, its leaves dark red, \\nlike a thousand bloodstained hands. A face had been carved in the trunk of the great tree, its features \\nlong and melancholy, the deep-cut eyes red with dried sap and strangely watchful. They were old, those \\neyes; older than Winterfell itself. They had seen Brandon the Builder set the first stone, if the tales were \\ntrue; they had watched the castle\\'s granite walls rise around them. It was said that the children of the \\nforest had carved the faces in the trees during the dawn centuries before the coming of the First Men \\nacross the narrow sea. \\nIn the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a thousand years ago, except on the \\nIsle of Faces where the green men kept their silent watch. Up here it was different. Here every castle had \\nits godswood, and every godswood had its heart tree, and every heart tree its face. \\nCatelyn found her husband beneath the weirwood, seated on a moss-covered stone. The greatsword \\nIce was across his lap, and he was cleaning the blade in those waters black as night. A thousand years of \\nhumus lay thick upon the godswood floor, swallowing the sound of her feet, but the red eyes of the \\nweirwood seemed to follow her as she came. \"Ned,\" she called softly. \\nHe lifted his head to look at her. \"Catelyn,\" he said. His voice was distant and formal. \"Where are the \\nchildren?\" \\nHe would always ask her that. \"In the kitchen, arguing about names for the wolf pups.\" She spread her \\ncloak on the forest floor and sat beside the pool, her back to the weirwood. She could feel the eyes \\nwatching her, but she did her best to ignore them. \"Arya is already in love, and Sansa is charmed and \\ngracious, but Rickon is not quite sure.\" \\n\"Is he afraid?\" Ned asked. \\n  15\\n\\n\"A little,\" she admitted. \"He is only three.\" \\nNed frowned. \"He must learn to face his fears. He will not be three forever. And winter is coming.\" \\n\"Yes,\" Catelyn agreed. The words gave her a chill, as they always did. The Stark words. Every noble \\nhouse had its words. Family mottoes, touchstones, prayers of sorts, they boasted of honor and glory, \\npromised loyalty and truth, swore faith and courage. All but the Starks. Winter is coming, said the Stark \\nwords. Not for the first time, she reflected on what a strange people these northerners; were. \\n\"The man died well, I\\'ll give him that,\" Ned said. He had a swatch of oiled leather in one hand. He ran it \\nlightly up the greatsword as he spoke, polishing the metal to a dark glow. \"I was glad for Bran\\'s sake. \\nYou would have been proud of Bran.\" \\n\"I am always proud of Bran,\" Catelyn replied, watching the sword as he stroked it. She could see the \\nrippling deep within the steel, where the metal had been folded back on itself a hundred times in the \\nforging. Catelyn had no love for swords, but she could not deny that Ice had its own beauty. It had been \\nforged in Valyria, before the Doom had come to the old Freehold, when the ironsmiths had worked their \\nmetal with spells as well as hammers. Four hundred years old it was, and as sharp as the day it was \\nforged. The name it bore was older still, a legacy from the age of heroes, when the Starks were Kings in \\nthe North. \\n\"He was the fourth this year,\" Ned said grimly. \"The poor man was half-mad. Something had put a fear \\nin him so deep that my words could not reach him.\" He sighed. \"Ben writes that the strength of the \\nNight\\'s Watch is down below a thousand. It\\'s not only desertions. They are losing men on rangings as \\nwell.\" \\n\"Is it the wildlings?\" she asked. \\n\"Who else?\" Ned lifted Ice, looked down the cool steel length of it. \"And it will only grow worse. The \\nday may come when I will have no choice but to call the banners and ride north to deal with this \\nKingbeyond-the-Wall for good and all.\" \\n\"Beyond the Wall?\" The thought made Catelyn shudder. \\nNed saw the dread on her face. \"Mance Rayder is nothing for us to fear.\" \\n\"There are darker things beyond the Wall.\" She glanced behind her at the heart tree, the pale bark and \\nred eyes, watching, listening, thinking its long slow thoughts. \\nHis smile was gentle. \"You listen to too many of Old Nan\\'s stories. The Others are as dead as the \\nchildren of the forest, gone eight thousand years. Maester Luwin will tell you they never lived at all. No \\nliving man has ever seen one.\" \\n\"Until this morning, no living man had ever seen a direwolf either,\" Catelyn reminded him. \\n\"I ought to know better than to argue with a Tully,\" he said with a rueful smile. He slid Ice back into its \\nsheath. \"You did not come here to tell me crib tales. I know how little you like this place. What is it, my \\nlady?\" \\nCatelyn took her husband\\'s hand. \"There was grievous news today, my lord. I did not wish to trouble \\nyou until you had cleansed yourself.\" There was no way to soften the blow, so she told him straight. \"I am \\n  16\\n\\nso sorry, my love. Jon Arryn is dead.\" \\nHis eyes found hers, and she could see how hard it took him, as she had known it would. In his youth, \\nNed had fostered at the Eyrie, and the childless Lord Arryn had become a second father to him and his \\nfellow ward, Robert Baratheon. When the Mad King Aerys 11 Targaryen had demanded their heads, \\nthe Lord of the Eyrie had raised his moon-and-falcon banners in revolt rather than give up those he had \\npledged to protect. \\nAnd one day fifteen years ago, this second father had become a brother as well, as he and Ned stood \\ntogether in the sept at Riverrun to wed two sisters, the daughters of Lord Hoster Tully. \\n\"Jon . . .\" he said. \"Is this news certain?\" \\n\"It was the king\\'s seal, and the letter is in Robert\\'s own hand. I saved it for you. He said Lord Arryn was \\ntaken quickly. Even Maester Pycelle was helpless, but he brought the milk of the poppy, so Jon did not \\nlinger long in pain.\" \\n\"That is some small mercy, I suppose,\" he said. She could see the grief on his face, but even then he \\nthought first of her. \"Your sister,\" he said. \"And Jon\\'s boy. What word of them?\" \\n\"The message said only that they were well, and had returned to the Eyrie,\" Catelyn said. \"I wish they \\nhad gone to Riverrun instead. The Eyrie is high and lonely, and it was ever her husband\\'s place, not hers. \\nLord Jon\\'s memory will haunt each stone. I know my sister. She needs the comfort of family and friends \\naround her.\" \\n\"Your uncle waits in the Vale, does he not? Jon named him Knight of the Gate, I\\'d heard.\" \\nCatelyn nodded. \"Brynden will do what he can for her, and for the boy. That is some comfort, but still . . \\n.\" \\n\"Go to her,\" Ned urged. \"Take the children. Fill her halls with noise and shouts and laughter. That boy of \\nhers needs other children about him, and Lysa should not be alone in her grief.\" \\n\"Would that I could,\" Catelyn said. \"The letter had other tidings. The king is riding to Winterfell to seek \\nyou out.\" \\nIt took Ned a moment to comprehend her words, but when the \\nunderstanding came, the darkness left his eyes. \"Robert is coming here?\" When she nodded, a smile \\nbroke across his face. \\nCatelyn wished she could share his joy. But she had heard the talk in the yards; a direwolf dead in the \\nsnow, a broken antler in its throat. Dread coiled within her like a snake, but she forced herself to smile at \\nthis man she loved, this man who put no faith in signs. \"I knew that would please you,\" she said. \"We \\nshould send word to your brother on the Wall.\" \\n\"Yes, of course,\" he agreed. \"Ben will want to be here. I shall tell Maester Luwin to send his swiftest \\nbird.\" Ned rose and pulled her to her feet. \"Damnation, how many years has it been? And he gives us no \\nmore notice than this? How many in his party, did the message say?\" \\n\"I should think a hundred knights, at the least, with all their retainers, and half again as many freeriders. \\n  17\\n\\nCersei and the children travel with them.\" \\n\"Robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes,\" he said. \"It is just as well. That will give us more time to \\nprepare.\" \\n\"The queen\\'s brothers are also in the party,\" she told him. \\nNed grimaced at that. There was small love between him and the queen\\'s family, Catelyn knew. The \\nLannisters of Casterly Rock had come late to Robert\\'s cause, when victory was all but certain, and he \\nhad never forgiven them. \"Well, if the price for Robert\\'s company is an infestation of Lannisters, so be it. \\nIt sounds as though Robert is bringing half his court.\" \\n\"Where the king goes, the realm follows,\" she said. \\n\"It will be good to see the children. The youngest was still sucking at the Lannister woman\\'s teat the last \\ntime I saw him. He must be, what, five by now?\" \\n\"Prince Tornmen is seven,\" she told him. \"The same age as Bran. Please, Ned, guard your tongue. The \\nLannister woman is our queen, and her pride is said to grow with every passing year.\" \\nNed squeezed her hand. \"There must be a feast, of course, with singers, and Robert will want to hunt. I \\nshall send Jory south with an honor guard to meet them on the kingsroad and escort them back. Gods, \\nhow are we going to feed them all? On his way already, you said? Damn the man. Damn his royal hide.\" \\nDAENERYS \\nHer brother held the gown up for her inspection. \"This is beauty. Touch it. Go on. Caress the fabric.\" \\nDany touched it. The cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like water. She could \\nnot remember ever wearing anything so soft. It frightened her. She pulled her hand away. \"Is it really \\nmine?\" \\n\"A gift from the Magister Illyrio,\" Viserys said, smiling. Her brother was in a high mood tonight. \"The \\ncolor will bring out the violet in your eyes. And you shall have gold as well, and jewels of all sorts. Illyrio \\nhas promised. Tonight you must look like a princess.\" \\nA princess, Dany thought. She had forgotten what that was like. Perhaps she had never really known. \\n\"Why does he give us so much?\" she asked. \"What does he want from us?\" For nigh on half a year, they \\nhad lived in the magister\\'s house, eating his food, pampered by his servants. Dany was thirteen, old \\nenough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price, here in the free city of Pentos. \\n\"Illyrio is no fool,\" Viserys said. He was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in his \\npale lilac eyes. \"The magister knows that I will not forget my friends when I come into my throne.\" \\nDany said nothing. Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and other, less \\nsavory things. He had friends in all of the Nine Free Cities, it was said, and even beyond, in Vaes \\nDothrak \\nand the fabled lands beside the Jade Sea. It was also said that he\\'d never had a friend he wouldn\\'t \\n  18\\n\\ncheerfully sell for the right price. Dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things, but \\nshe knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream. His anger was a terrible \\nthing when roused. Viserys called it \"waking the dragon.\" \\nHer brother hung the gown beside the door. \"Illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you. Be sure you wash \\noff the stink of the stables. Khal Drogo has a thousand horses, tonight he looks for a different sort of \\nmount.\" He studied her critically. \"You still slouch. Straighten yourself\" He pushed back her shoulders \\nwith his hands. \"Let them see that you have a woman\\'s shape now.\" His fingers brushed lightly over her \\nbudding breasts and tightened on a nipple. \"You will not fail me tonight. If you do, it will go hard for you. \\nYou don\\'t want to wake the dragon, do you?\" His fingers twisted her, the pinch cruelly hard through the \\nrough fabric of her tunic. \"Do you?\" he repeated. \\n\"No,\" Dany said meekly. \\nHer brother smiled. \"Good.\" He touched her hair, almost with affection. \"When they write the history of \\nmy reign, sweet sister, they will say that it began tonight.\" \\nWhen he was gone, Dany went to her window and looked out wistfully on the waters of the bay. The \\nsquare brick towers of Pentos were black silhouettes outlined against the setting sun. Dany could hear the \\nsinging of the red priests as they lit their night fires and the shouts of ragged children playing games \\nbeyond the walls of the estate. For a moment she wished she could be out there with them, barefoot and \\nbreathless and dressed in tatters, with no past and no future and no feast to attend at Khal Drogo\\'s \\nmanse. \\nSomewhere beyond the sunset, across the narrow sea, lay a land of green hills and flowered plains and \\ngreat rushing rivers, where towers of dark stone rose amidst magnificent blue-grey mountains, and \\narmored knights rode to battle beneath the banners of their lords. The Dothraki called that land Rhaesh \\nAndahli, the land of the Andals. In the Free Cities, they talked of Westeros and the Sunset Kingdoms. \\nHer brother had a simpler name. \"Our land,\" he called it. The words were like a prayer with him. If he \\nsaid them enough, the gods were sure to hear. \"Ours by blood right, taken from us by treachery, but ours \\nstill, ours forever. You do not steal from the dragon, oh, no. The dragon remembers.\" \\nAnd perhaps the dragon did remember, but Dany could not. She had never seen this land her brother \\nsaid was theirs, this realm beyond the narrow sea. These places he talked of, Casterly Rock and the \\nEyrie, Highgarden and the Vale of Arryn, Dorne and the Isle of Faces, they were just words to her. \\nViserys had been a boy of eight when they fled King\\'s Landing to escape the advancing armies of the \\nUsurper, but Daenerys had been only a quickening in their mother\\'s womb. \\nYet sometimes Dany would picture the way it had been, so often had her brother told her the stories. \\nThe midnight flight to Dragonstone, moonlight shimmering on the ship\\'s black sails. Her brother Rhaegar \\nbattling the Usurper in the bloody waters of the Trident and dying for the woman he loved. The sack of \\nKing\\'s Landing by the ones Viserys called the Usurper\\'s dogs, the lords Lannister and Stark. Princess \\nElia of Dorne pleading for mercy as Rhaegar\\'s heir was ripped from her breast and murdered before her \\neyes. The polished skulls of the last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room \\nwhile the Kingslayer opened Father\\'s throat with a golden sword. \\nShe had been born on Dragonstone nine moons after their flight, while a raging summer storm threatened \\nto rip the island fastness apart. They said that storm was terrible. The Targaryen fleet was smashed while \\nit lay at anchor, and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild \\nwaters of the narrow sea. Her mother had died birthing her, and for that her brother Viserys had never \\n  19\\n\\nforgiven her. \\nShe did not remember Dragonstone either. They had run again, just before the Usurper\\'s brother set sail \\nwith his new-built fleet. By then only Dragonstone itself, the ancient seat of their House, had remained of \\nthe Seven Kingdoms that had once been theirs. It would not remain for long. The garrison had been \\nprepared to sell them to the Usurper, but one night Ser Willem Darry and four loyal men had broken into \\nthe nursery and stolen them both, along with her wet nurse, and set sail under cover of darkness for the \\nsafety of the Braavosian coast. \\nShe remembered Ser Willem dimly, a great grey bear of a man, halfblind, roaring and bellowing orders \\nfrom his sickbed. The servants had lived in terror of him, but he had always been kind to Dany. He called \\nher \"Little Princess\" and sometimes \"My Lady,\" and his hands were soft as old leather. He never left his \\nbed, though, and the smell of sickness clung to him day and night, a hot, moist, sickly sweet odor. That \\nwas when they lived in Braavos, in the big house with the red door. Dany had her own room there, with a \\nlemon tree outside her window. After Ser Willem had died, the servants had stolen what little money they \\nhad left, and soon after they had been put out of the big house. Dany had cried when the red door closed \\nbehind them forever. \\nThey had wandered since then, from Braavos to Myr, from Myr to Tyrosh, and on to Qohor and \\nVolantis and Lys, never staying long in \\nany one place. Her brother would not allow it. The Usurper\\'s hired knives were close behind them, he \\ninsisted, though Dany had never seen one. \\nAt first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last Targaryens to \\ntheir homes and tables, but as the years passed and the Usurper continued to sit upon the Iron Throne, \\ndoors closed and their lives grew meaner. Years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures, \\nand now even the coin they had gotten from Mother\\'s crown had gone. In the alleys and wine sinks of \\nPentos, they called her brother \"the beggar king.\" Dany did not want to know what they called her. \\n\"We will have it all back someday, sweet sister,\" he would promise her. Sometimes his hands shook \\nwhen he talked about it. \"The jewels and the silks, Dragonstone and King\\'s Landing, the Iron Throne and \\nthe Seven Kingdoms, all they have taken from us, we will have it back.\" Viserys lived for that day. All \\nthat Daenerys wanted back was the big house with the red door, the lemon tree outside her window, the \\nchildhood she had never known. \\nThere came a soft knock on her door. \"Come,\" Dany said, turning away from the window. Illyrio\\'s \\nservants entered, bowed, and set about their business. They were slaves, a gift from one of the magister\\'s \\nmany Dothraki friends. There was no slavery in the free city of Pentos. Nonetheless, they were slaves. \\nThe old woman, small and grey as a mouse, never said a word, but the girl made up for it. She was \\nIllyrio\\'s favorite, a fair-haired, blue-eyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as she worked. \\nThey filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented it with fragrant oils. The girl \\npulled the rough cotton tunic over Dany\\'s head and helped her into the tub. The water was scalding hot, \\nbut Daenerys did not flinch or cry out. She liked the heat. It made her feel clean. Besides, her brother \\nhad often told her that it was never too \\nhot for a Targaryen. \"Ours is the house of the dragon,\" he would say. \"The fire is in our blood.\" \\nThe old woman washed her long, silver-pale hair and gently combed out the snags, all in silence. The girl \\nscrubbed her back and her feet and told her how lucky she was. \"Drogo is so rich that even his slaves \\n  20\\n\\nwear golden collars. A hundred thousand men ride in his khalasar, and \\nhis palace in Vaes Dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver.\" There was more like that, \\nso much more, what a handsome \\nman the khal was, so tall and fierce, fearless in battle, the best rider ever to mount a horse, a demon \\narcher. Daenerys said nothing. She had always assumed that she would wed Viserys when she came of \\nage. \\nFor centuries the Targaryens had married brother to sister, since Aegon the Conqueror had taken his \\nsisters to bride. The line must be kept pure, Viserys had told her a thousand times; theirs was the \\nkingsblood, the golden blood of old Valyria, the blood of the dragon. Dragons did not mate with the \\nbeasts of the field, and Targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of lesser men. Yet now Viserys \\nschemed to sell her to a stranger, a barbarian. \\nWhen she was clean, the slaves helped her from the water and toweled her dry. The girl brushed her hair \\nuntil it shone like molten silver, while the old woman anointed her with the spiceflower perfume of the \\nDothraki plains, a dab on each wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her breasts, and one last one, cool \\non her lips, down there between her legs. They dressed her in the wisps that Magister Illyrio had sent up, \\nand then the gown, a deep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes. The girl slid the gilded sandals \\nonto her feet, while the old woman fixed the tiara in her hair, and slid golden bracelets crusted with \\namethysts around her wrists. Last of all came the collar, a heavy golden tore emblazoned with ancient \\nValyrian glyphs. \\n\"Now you look all a princess,\" the girl said breathlessly when they were done. Dany glanced at her \\nimage in the silvered looking glass that Illyrio had so thoughtfully provided. A princess, she thought, but \\nshe remembered what the girl had said, how Khal Drogo was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars. \\nShe felt a sudden chill, and gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms. \\nHer brother was waiting in the cool of the entry hall, seated on the edge of the pool, his hand trailing in \\nthe water. He rose when she appeared and looked her over critically. \"Stand there,\" he told her. \"Turn \\naround. Yes. Good. You look . . .\" \\n\"Regal,\" Magister Illyrio said, stepping through an archway. He moved with surprising delicacy for such \\na massive man. Beneath loose garments of flame-colored silk, rolls of fat jiggled as he walked. \\nGemstones glittered on every finger, and his man had oiled his forked yellow beard until it shone like real \\ngold. \"May the Lord of Light shower you with blessings on this most fortunate day, Princess Daenerys,\" \\nthe magister said as he took her hand. He bowed his head, showing a thin glimpse of crooked yellow \\nteeth through the gold of his beard. \"She is a vision, Your Grace, a vision,\" he told her brother. \"Drogo \\nwill be enraptured.\" \\n\"She\\'s too skinny,\" Viserys said. His hair, the same silver-blond as hers, had been pulled back tightly \\nbehind his head and fastened with a dragonbone brooch. It was a severe look that emphasized the hard, \\ngaunt lines of his face. He rested his hand on the hilt of the sword that \\nIllyrio had lent him, and said, \"Are you sure that Khal Drogo likes his women this young?\" \\n\"She has had her blood. She is old enough for the khal, \" Illyrio told him, not for the first time. \"Look at \\nher. That silvergold hair, those purple eyes . . . she is the blood of old Valyria, no doubt, no doubt . . . \\nand highborn, daughter of the old king, sister to the new, she cannot fail to entrance our Drogo.\" When \\nhe released her hand, Daenerys found herself trembling. \\n  21\\n\\n\"I suppose,\" her brother said doubtfully. \"The savages have queer tastes. Boys, horses, sheep . . .\" \\n\"Best not suggest this to Khal Drogo,\" Illyrio said. \\nAnger flashed in her brother\\'s lilac eyes. \"Do you take me for a fool?\" \\nThe magister bowed slightly. \"I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My \\napologies if I have given offense.\" He turned away and clapped his hands for his bearers. \\nThe streets of Pentos were pitch-dark when they set out in Illyrio\\'s elaborately carved palanquin. Two \\nservants went ahead to light their way, carrying ornate oil lanterns with panes of pale blue glass, while a \\ndozen strong men hoisted the poles to their shoulders. It was warm and close inside behind the curtains. \\nDany could smell the stench of Illyrio\\'s pallid flesh through his heavy perfumes. \\nHer brother, sprawled out on his pillows beside her, never noticed. His mind was away across the \\nnarrow sea. \"We won\\'t need his whole khalasar, \" Viserys said. His fingers toyed with the hilt of his \\nborrowed blade, though Dany knew he had never used a sword in earnest. \"Ten thousand, that would be \\nenough, I could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers. The realm will rise \\nfor its rightful king. Tyrell, Redwyne, Darry, Greyjoy, they have no more love for the Usurper than I do. \\nThe Dornishmen burn to avenge Elia and her children. And the smallfolk will be with us. They cry out for \\ntheir king.\" He looked at Illyrio anxiously. \"They do, don\\'t they?\" \\n\"They are your people, and they love you well,\" Magister Illyrio said amiably. \"In holdfasts all across the \\nrealm, men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the \\nday of your return from across the water.\" He gave a massive shrug. \"Or so my agents tell me.\" \\nDany had no agents, no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea, but \\nshe mistrusted Illyrio\\'s sweet words as she mistrusted everything about Illyrio. Her brother was nodding \\neagerly, however. \"I shall kill the Usurper myself,\" he promised, who \\nhad never killed anyone, \"as he killed my brother Rhaegar. And Lannister too, the Kingslayer, for what \\nhe did to my father.\" \\n\"That would be most fitting,\" Magister Illyrio said. Dany saw the smallest hint of a smile playing around \\nhis full lips, but her brother did not notice. Nodding, he pushed back a curtain and stared off into the \\nnight, and Dany knew he was fighting the Battle of the Trident once again. \\nThe nine-towered manse of Khal Drogo sat beside the waters of the bay, its high brick walls overgrown \\nwith pale ivy. It had been given to the khal by the magisters of Pentos, Illyrio told them. The Free Cities \\nwere always generous with the horselords. \"It is not that we fear these barbarians,\" Illyrio would explain \\nwith a smile. \"The Lord of Light would hold our city walls against a million Dothraki, or so the red priests \\npromise . . . yet why take chances, when their friendship comes so cheap?\" \\nTheir palanquin was stopped at the gate, the curtains pulled roughly back by one of the house guards. \\nHe had the copper skin and dark almond eyes of a Dothraki, but his face was hairless and he wore the \\nspiked bronze cap of the Unsullied. He looked them over coldly. Magister Illyrio growled something to \\nhim in the rough Dothraki tongue; the guardsman replied in the same voice and waved them through the \\ngates. \\nDany noticed that her brother\\'s hand was clenched tightly around the hilt of his borrowed sword. He \\n  22\\n\\nlooked almost as frightened as she felt. \"Insolent eunuch,\" Viserys muttered as the palanquin lurched up \\ntoward the manse. \\nMagister Illyrio\\'s words were honey. \"Many important men will be at the feast tonight. Such men have \\nenemies. The khal must protect his guests, yourself chief among them, Your Grace. No doubt the \\nUsurper would pay well for your head.\" \\n\"Oh, yes,\" Viserys said darkly. \"He has tried, Illyrio, I promise you that. His hired knives follow us \\neverywhere. I am the last dragon, and he will not sleep easy while I live.\" \\nThe palanquin slowed and stopped. The curtains were thrown back, and a slave offered a hand to help \\nDaenerys out. His collar, she noted, was ordinary bronze. Her brother followed, one hand still clenched \\nhard around his sword hilt. It took two strong men to get Magister Illyrio back on his feet. \\nInside the manse, the air was heavy with the scent of spices, pinchfire and sweet lemon and cinnamon. \\nThey were escorted across the entry hall, where a mosaic of colored glass depicted the Doom of Valyria. \\nOil burned in black iron lanterns all along the walls. Beneath \\nan arch of twining stone leaves, a eunuch sang their coming. \"Viserys of the House Targaryen, the Third \\nof his Name,\" he called in a high, sweet voice, \"King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, \\nLord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. His sister, Daenerys Stormborn, Princess of \\nDragonstone. His honorable host, Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of the Free City of Pentos.\" \\nThey stepped past the eunuch into a pillared courtyard overgrown in pale ivy. Moonlight painted the \\nleaves in shades of bone and silver as the guests drifted among them. Many were Dothraki horselords, \\nbig men with red-brown skin, their drooping mustachios bound in metal rings, their black hair oiled and \\nbraided and hung with bells. Yet among them moved bravos and sellswords from Pentos and Myr and \\nTyrosh, a red priest even fatter than Illyrio, hairy men from the Port of Ibben, and lords from the Summer \\nIsles with skin as black as ebony. Daenerys looked at them all in wonder . . . and realized, with a sudden \\nstart of fear, that she was the only woman there. \\nIllyrio whispered to them. \"Those three are Drogo\\'s bloodriders, there,\" he said. \"By the pillar is Khal \\nMoro, with his son Rhogoro. The man with the green beard is brother to the Archon of Tyrosh, and the \\nman behind him is Ser Jorah Mormont.\" \\nThe last name caught Daenerys. \"A knight?\" \\n\"No less.\" Illyrio smiled through his beard. \"Anointed with the seven oils by the High Septon himself.\" \\n\"What is he doing here?\" she blurted. \\n\"The Usurper wanted his head,\" Illyrio told them. \"Some trifling affront. He sold some poachers to a \\nTyroshi slaver instead of giving them to the Night\\'s Watch. Absurd law. A man should be able to do as \\nhe likes with his own chattel.\" \\n\"I shall wish to speak with Ser Jorah before the night is done,\" her brother said. Dany found herself \\nlooking at the knight curiously. He was an older man, past forty and balding, but still strong and fit. \\nInstead of silks and cottons, he wore wool and leather. His tunic was a dark green, embroidered with the \\nlikeness of a black bear standing on two legs. \\nShe was still looking at this strange man from the homeland she had never known when Magister Illyrio \\n  23\\n\\nplaced a moist hand on her bare shoulder. \"Over there, sweet princess,\" he whispered, \"there is the khal \\nhimself.\" \\nDany wanted to run and hide, but her brother was looking at her, and if she displeased him she knew \\nshe would wake the dragon. Anxiously, she turned and looked at the man Viserys hoped would ask to \\nwed her before the night was done. \\nThe slave girl had not been far wrong, she thought. Khal Drogo was a head taller than the tallest man in \\nthe room, yet somehow light on his feet, as graceful as the panther in Illyrio\\'s menagerie. He was younger \\nthan she\\'d thought, no more than thirty. His skin was the color of polished copper, his thick mustachios \\nbound with gold and bronze rings. \\n\"I must go and make my submissions,\" Magister Illyrio said. \"Wait here. I shall bring him to you.\" \\nHer brother took her by the arm as Illyrio waddled over to the khal, his fingers squeezing so hard that \\nthey hurt. \"Do you see his braid, sweet sister?\" \\nDrogo\\'s braid was black as midnight and heavy with scented oil, hung with tiny bells that rang softly as \\nhe moved. It swung well past his belt, below even his buttocks, the end of it brushing against the back of \\nhis thighs. \\n\"You see how long it is?\" Viserys said. \"When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braids \\nin disgrace, so the world will know their shame. Khal Drogo has never lost a fight. He is Aegon the \\nDragonlord come again, and you will be his queen.\" \\nDany looked at Khal Drogo. His face was hard and cruel, his eyes as cold and dark as onyx. Her \\nbrother hurt her sometimes, when she woke the dragon, but he did not frighten her the way this man \\nfrightened her. \"I don\\'t want to be his queen,\" she heard herself say in a small, thin voice. \"Please, please, \\nViserys, I don\\'t want to, I want to go home.\" \\n\"Home?\" He kept his voice low, but she could hear the fury in his tone. \"How are we to go home, sweet \\nsister? They took our home from us!\" He drew her into the shadows, out of sight, his fingers digging into \\nher skin. \"How are we to go home?\" he repeated, meaning King\\'s Landing, and Dragonstone, and all the \\nrealm they had lost. \\nDany had only meant their rooms in Illyrio\\'s estate, no true home surely, though all they had, but her \\nbrother did not want to hear that. There was no home there for him. Even the big house with the red door \\nhad not been home for him. His fingers dug hard into her arm, demanding an answer. \"I don\\'t know she \\nsaid at last, her voice breaking. Tears welled in her eyes. \\n\"I do,\" he said sharply. \"We go home with an army, sweet sister. With Khal Drogo\\'s army, that is how \\nwe go home. And if you must wed him and bed him for that, you will.\" He smiled at her. \"I\\'d let his whole \\nkhalasar fuck you if need be, sweet sister, all forty thousand men, and their horses too if that was what it \\ntook to get my army. Be grateful it is \\nonly Drogo. In time you may even learn to like him. Now dry your eyes. Illyrio is bringing him over, and \\nhe will not see you crying.\" \\nDany turned and saw that it was true. Magister Illyrio, all smiles and bows, was escorting Khal Drogo \\nover to where they stood. She brushed away unfallen tears with the back of her hand. \\n  24\\n\\n\"Smile,\" Viserys whispered nervously, his hand failing to the hilt of his sword. \"And stand up straight. Let \\nhim see that you have breasts. Gods know, you have little enough as is.\" \\nDaenerys smiled, and stood up straight. \\nEDDARD \\nThe visitors poured through the castle gates in a river of gold and silver and polished steel, three hundred \\nstrong, a pride of bannermen and knights, of sworn swords and freeriders. Over their heads a dozen \\ngolden banners whipped back and forth in the northern wind, emblazoned with the crowned stag of \\nBaratheon. \\nNed knew many of the riders. There came Ser Jaime Lannister with hair as bright as beaten gold, and \\nthere Sandor Clegane with his terrible burned face. The tall boy beside him could only be the crown \\nprince, and that stunted little man behind them was surely the Imp, Tyrion Lannister. \\nYet the huge man at the head of the column, flanked by two knights in the snow-white cloaks of the \\nKingsguard, seemed almost a stranger to Ned . . . until he vaulted off the back of his warhorse with a \\nfamiliar roar, and crushed him in a bone-crunching hug. \"Ned! Ah, but it is good to see that frozen face of \\nyours.\" The king looked him over top to bottom, and laughed. \"You have not changed at all.\" \\nWould that Ned had been able to say the same. Fifteen years past, when they had ridden forth to win a \\nthrone, the Lord of Storm\\'s End had been clean-shaven, clear-eyed, and muscled like a maiden\\'s fantasy. \\nSix and a half feet tall, he towered over lesser men, and when he donned his armor and the great antlered \\nhelmet of his House, he became a veritable giant. He\\'d had a giant\\'s strength too, his weapon \\nof choice a spiked iron warhammer that Ned could scarcely lift. In those days, the smell of leather and \\nblood had clung to him like perfume. \\nNow it was perfume that clung to him like perfume, and he had a girth to match his height. Ned had last \\nseen the king nine years before during Balon Greyjoy\\'s rebellion, when the stag and the direwolf had \\njoined to end the pretensions of the self-proclaimed King of the Iron Islands. Since the night they had \\nstood side by side in Greyjoy\\'s fallen stronghold, where Robert had accepted the rebel lord\\'s surrender \\nand Ned had taken his son Theon as hostage and ward, the king had gained at least eight stone. A beard \\nas coarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the royal jowls, \\nbut nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes. \\nYet Robert was Ned\\'s king now, and not just a friend, so he said only, \"Your Grace. Winterfell is \\nyours.\" \\nBy then the others were dismounting as well, and grooms were coming forward for their mounts. \\nRobert\\'s queen, Cersei Lannister, entered on foot with her younger children. The wheelhouse in which \\nthey had ridden, a huge double-decked carriage of oiled oak and gilded metal pulled by forty heavy draft \\nhorses, was too wide to pass through the castle gate. Ned knelt in the snow to kiss the queen\\'s ring, \\nwhile Robert embraced Catelyn like a long-lost sister. Then the children had been brought forward, \\nintroduced, and approved of by both sides. \\nNo sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to his host, \"Take me \\ndown to your crypt, Eddard. I would pay my respects.\" \\n  25\\n\\nNed loved him for that, for remembering her still after all these years. He called for a lantern. No other \\nwords were needed. The queen had begun to protest. They had been riding since dawn, everyone was \\ntired and cold, surely they should refresh themselves first. The dead would wait. She had said no more \\nthan that; Robert had looked at her, and her twin brother Jaime had taken her quietly by the arm, and she \\nhad said no more. \\nThey went down to the crypt together, Ned and this king he scarcely recognized. The winding stone \\nsteps were narrow. Ned went first with the lantern. \"I was starting to think we would never reach \\nWinterfell,\" Robert complained as they descended. \"In the south, the way they talk about my Seven \\nKingdoms, a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined.\" \\n\"I trust you enjoyed the journey, Your Grace?\" \\nRobert snorted. \"Bogs and forests and fields, and scarcely a decent \\ninn north of the Neck. I\\'ve never seen such a vast emptiness. Where are all yourpeople?\" \\n\"Likely they were too shy to come out,\" Ned jested. He could feel the chill coming up the stairs, a cold \\nbreath from deep within the earth. \"Kings are a rare sight in the north.\" \\nRobert snorted. \"More likely they were hiding under the snow. Snow, Ned!\" The king put one hand on \\nthe wall to steady himself as they descended. \\n\"Late summer snows are common enough,\" Ned said. \"I hope they did not trouble you. They are usually \\nmild.\" \\n\"The Others take your mild snows,\" Robert swore. \"What will this place be like in winter? I shudder to \\nthink.\" \\n\"The winters are hard,\" Ned admitted. \"But the Starks will endure. We always have.\" \\n\"You need to come south,\" Robert told him. \"You need a taste of summer before it flees. In Highgarden \\nthere are fields of golden roses that stretch away as far as the eye can see. The fruits are so ripe they \\nexplode in your mouth-melons, peaches, fireplums, you\\'ve never tasted such sweetness. You\\'ll see, I \\nbrought you some. Even at Storm\\'s End, with that good wind off the bay, the days are so hot you can \\nbarely move. And you ought to see the towns, Ned! Flowers everywhere, the markets bursting with \\nfood, the surnmerwines so cheap and so good that you can get drunk just breathing the air. Everyone is \\nfat and drunk and rich.\" He laughed and slapped his own ample stomach a thump. \"And the girls, Ned!\" \\nhe exclaimed, his eyes sparkling. \"I swear, women lose all modesty in the heat. They swim naked in the \\nriver, right beneath the castle. Even in the streets, it\\'s too damn hot for wool or fur, so they go around in \\nthese short gowns, silk if they have the silver and cotton if not, but it\\'s all the same when they start \\nsweating and the cloth sticks to their skin, they might as well be naked.\" The king laughed happily. \\nRobert Baratheon had always been a man of huge appetites, a man who knew how to take his \\npleasures. That was not a charge anyone could lay at the door of Eddard Stark. Yet Ned could not help \\nbut notice that those pleasures were taking a toll on the king. Robert was breathing heavily by the time \\nthey reached the bottom of the stairs, his face red in the lantern light as they stepped out into the darkness \\nof the crypt. \\n\"Your Grace,\" Ned said respectfully. He swept the lantern in a wide semicircle. Shadows moved and \\n  26\\n\\nlurched. Flickering light touched the stones underfoot and brushed against a long procession of granite \\npillars that marched ahead, two by two, into the dark. Between the \\npillars, the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls, backs against the sepulchres that contained \\ntheir mortal remains. \"She is down at the end, with Father and Brandon.\" \\nHe led the way between the pillars and Robert followed wordlessly, shivering in the subterranean chill. It \\nwas always cold down here. Their footsteps rang off the stones and echoed in the vault overhead as they \\nwalked among the dead of House Stark. The Lords of Winterfell watched them pass. Their likenesses \\nwere carved into the stones that sealed the tombs. In long rows they sat, blind eyes staring out into \\neternal darkness, while great stone direwolves curled round their feet. The shifting shadows made the \\nstone figures seem to stir as the living passed by. \\nBy ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been Lord of \\nWinterfell, to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts. The oldest had long ago rusted away to nothing, \\nleaving only a few red stains where the metal had rested on stone. Ned wondered if that meant those \\nghosts were free to roam the castle now. He hoped not. The first Lords of Winterfell had been men hard \\nas the land they ruled. In the centuries before the Dragonlords came over the sea, they had sworn \\nallegiance to no man, styling themselves the Kings in the North. \\nNed stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern. The crypt continued on into darkness ahead of them, but \\nbeyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed; black holes waiting for their dead, waiting for him \\nand his children. Ned did not like to think on that. \"Here,\" he told his king. \\nRobert nodded silently, knelt, and bowed his head. \\nThere were three tombs, side by side. Lord Rickard Stark, Ned\\'s father, had a long, stern face. The \\nstonemason had known him well. He sat with quiet dignity, stone fingers holding tight to the sword across \\nhis lap, but in life all swords had failed him. In two smaller sepulchres on either side were his children. \\nBrandon had been twenty when he died, strangled by order of the Mad King Aerys Targaryen only a \\nfew short days before he was to wed Catelyn Tully of Riverrun. His father had been forced to watch him \\ndie. He was the true heir, the eldest, born to rule. \\nLyanna had only been sixteen, a child-woman of surpassing loveliness. Ned had loved her with all his \\nheart. Robert had loved her even more. She was to have been his bride. \\n\"She was more beautiful than that,\" the king said after a silence. His eyes lingered on Lyanna\\'s face, as if \\nhe could will her back to life. Finally he rose, made awkward by his weight. \"Ah, damn it, Ned, did \\nyou have to bury her in a place like this?\" His voice was hoarse with remembered grief. \"She deserved \\nmore than darkness . . .\" \\n\"She was a Stark of Winterfell,\" Ned said quietly. \"This is her place.\" \\n\"She should be on a hill somewhere, under a fruit tree, with the sun and clouds above her and the rain to \\nwash her clean.\" \\n\"I was with her when she died,\" Ned reminded the king. \"She wanted to come home, to rest beside \\nBrandon and Father.\" He could hear her still at times. Promise me, she had cried, in a room that smelled \\nof blood and roses. Promise me, Ned. The fever had taken her strength and her voice had been faint as a \\n  27\\n\\nwhisper, but when he gave her his word, the fear had gone out of his sister\\'s eyes. Ned remembered the \\nway she had smiled then, how tightly her fingers had clutched his as she gave up her hold on life, the rose \\npetals spilling from her palm, dead and black. After that he remembered nothing. They had found him still \\nholding her body, silent with grief. The little crannogman, Howland Reed, had taken her hand from his. \\nNed could recall none of it. \"I bring her flowers when I can,\" he said. \"Lyanna was . . . fond of flowers.\" \\nThe king touched her cheek, his fingers brushing across the rough stone as gently as if it were living flesh. \\n\"I vowed to kill Rhaegar for what he did to her.\" \\n\"You did,\" Ned reminded him. \\n\"Only once,\" Robert said bitterly. \\nThey had come together at the ford of the Trident while the battle crashed around them, Robert with his \\nwarhammer and his great antlered helm, the Targaryen prince armored all in black. On his breastplate \\nwas the three-headed dragon of his House, wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the sunlight. The \\nwaters of the Trident ran red around the hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed, again and \\nagain, until at last a crushing blow from Robert\\'s hammer stove in the dragon and the chest beneath it. \\nWhen Ned had finally come on the scene, Rhaegar lay dead in the stream, while men of both armies \\nscrabbled in the swirling waters for rubies knocked free of his armor. \\n\"In my dreams, I kill him every night,\" Robert admitted. \"A thousand deaths will still be less than he \\ndeserves.\" \\nThere was nothing Ned could say to that. After a quiet, he said, \"We should return, Your Grace. Your \\nwife will be waiting.\" \\n\"The Others take my wife,\" Robert muttered sourly, but he started back the way they had come, his \\nfootsteps falling heavily. \"And if I hear \\'Your Grace\\' once more, I\\'ll have your head on a spike. We are \\nmore to each other than that.\" \\n\"I had not forgotten,\" Ned replied quietly. When the king did not answer, he said, \"Tell me about Jon.\" \\nRobert shook his head. \"I have never seen a man sicken so quickly. We gave a tourney on my son\\'s \\nname day. If you had seen Jon then, you would have sworn he would live forever. A fortnight later he \\nwas dead. The sickness was like a fire in his gut. It burned right through him.\" He paused beside a pillar, \\nbefore the tomb of a long-dead Stark. \"I loved that old man.\" \\n\"We both did.\" Ned paused a moment. \"Catelyn fears for her sister. How does Lysa bear her grief?\" \\nRobert\\'s mouth gave a bitter twist. \"Not well, in truth,\" he admitted. \"I think losing Jon has driven the \\nwoman mad, Ned. She has taken the boy back to the Eyrie. Against my wishes. I had hoped to foster \\nhim with Tywin Lannister at Casterly Rock. Jon had no brothers, no other sons. Was I supposed to leave \\nhim to be raised by women?\" \\nNed would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than to Lord Tywin, but he left his doubts unspoken. \\nSome old wounds never truly heal, and bleed again at the slightest word. \"The wife has lost the husband,\" \\nhe said carefully. \"Perhaps-the mother feared to lose the son. The boy is very young.\" \\n\"Six, and sickly, and Lord of the Eyrie, gods have mercy,\" the king swore. \"Lord Tywin had never taken \\na ward before. Lysa ought to have been honored. The Lannisters are a great and noble House. She \\n  28\\n\\nrefused to even hear of it. Then she left in the dead of night, without so much as a by-your-leave. Cersei \\nwas furious.\" He sighed deeply. \"The boy is my namesake, did you know that? Robert Arryn. I am \\nsworn to protect him. How can I do that if his mother steals him away?\" \\n\"I will take him as ward, if you wish,\" Ned said. \"Lysa should consent to that. She and Catelyn were \\nclose as girls, and she would be welcome here as well.\" \\n\"A generous offer, my friend,\" the king said, \"but too late. Lord Tywin has already given his consent. \\nFostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him.\" \\n\"I have more concern for my nephew\\'s welfare than I do for Lannister pride,\" Ned declared. \\n\"That is because you do not sleep with a Lannister.\" Robert laughed, the sound rattling among the tombs \\nand bouncing from the vaulted ceiling. His smile was a flash of white teeth in the thicket of the huge black \\nbeard. \"Ah, Ned,\" he said, \"you are still too serious.\" He put a massive arm around Ned\\'s shoulders. \"I \\nhad planned to wait a few days to speak to you, but I see now there\\'s no need for it. Come, walk with \\nme.\" \\nThey started back down between the pillars. Blind stone eyes seemed to follow them as they passed. \\nThe king kept his arm around Ned\\'s shoulder. \"You must have wondered why I finally came north to \\nWinterfell, after so long.\" \\nNed had his suspicions, but he did not give them voice. \"For the joy of my company, surely,\" he said \\nlightly. \"And there is the Wall. You need to see it, Your Grace, to walk along its battlements and talk to \\nthose who man it. The Night\\'s Watch is a shadow of what it once was. Benjen says-\" \\n\"No doubt I will hear what your brother says soon enough,\" Robert said. \"The Wall has stood for what, \\neight thousand years? It can keep a few days more. I have more pressing concerns. These are difficult \\ntimes. I need good men about me. Men like Jon Arryn. He served as Lord of the Eyrie, as Warden of \\nthe East, as the Hand of the King. He will not be easy to replace.\" \\n\"His son . . .\" Ned began. \\n\"His son will succeed to the Eyrie and all its incomes,\" Robert said brusquely. \"No more.\" \\nThat took Ned by surprise. He stopped, startled, and turned to look at his king. The words came \\nunbidden. \"The Arryns have always been Wardens of the East. The title goes with the domain.\" \\n\"Perhaps when he comes of age, the honor can be restored to him,\" Robert said. \"I have this year to \\nthink of, and next. A six-year-old boy is no war leader, Ned.\" \\n\"In peace, the title is only an honor. Let the boy keep it. For his father\\'s sake if not his own. Surely you \\nowe, Jon that much for his service.\" \\nThe king was not pleased. He took his arm from around Ned\\'s shoulders. \"Jon\\'s service was the duty he \\nowed his liege lord. I am not ungrateful, Ned. You of all men ought to know that. But the son is not the \\nfather. A mere boy cannot hold the east.\" Then his tone softened. \"Enough of this. There is a more \\nimportant office to discuss, and I would not argue with you.\" Robert grasped Ned by the elbow. \"I have \\nneed of you, Ned.\" \\n\"I am yours to command, Your Grace. Always.\" They were words he had to say, and so he said them, \\n  29\\n\\napprehensive about what might come next. \\nRobert scarcely seemed to hear him. \"Those years we spent in the Eyrie . . . gods, those were good \\nyears. I want you at my side again, Ned. I want you down in King\\'s Landing, not up here at the end of \\nthe world where you are no damned use to anybody.\" Robert looked off into the darkness, for a moment \\nas melancholy as a Stark. \"I swear to \\nyou, sitting a throne is a thousand times harder than winning one. Laws are a tedious business and \\ncounting coppers is worse. And the people . . . there is no end of them. I sit on that damnable iron chair \\nand listen to them complain until my mind is numb and my ass is raw. They all want something, money or \\nland or justice. The lies they tell . . . and my lords and ladies are no better. I am surrounded by flatterers \\nand fools. It can drive a man to madness, Ned. Half of them don\\'t dare tell me the truth, and the other \\nhalf can\\'t find it. There are nights I wish we had lost at the Trident. Ah, no, not truly, but \\n\"I understand,\" Ned said softly. \\nRobert looked at him. \"I think you do. If so, you are the only one, my old friend.\" He smiled. \"Lord \\nEddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the King.\" \\nNed dropped to one knee. The offer did not surprise him; what other reason could Robert have had for \\ncoming so far? The Hand of the King was the second-most powerful man in the Seven Kingdoms. He \\nspoke with the king\\'s voice, commanded the king\\'s armies, drafted the king\\'s laws. At times he even sat \\nupon the Iron Throne to dispense king\\'s justice, when the king was absent, or sick, or otherwise \\nindisposed. Robert was offering him a responsibility as large as the realm itself. \\nIt was the last thing in the world he wanted. \\n\"Your Grace,\" he said. \"I am not worthy of the honor.\" \\nRobert groaned with good-humored impatience. \"If I wanted to honor you, I\\'d let you retire. I am \\nplanning to make you run the kingdom and fight the wars while I eat and drink and wench myself into an \\nearly grave.\" He slapped his gut and grinned. \"You know the saying, about the king and his Hand?\" \\nNed knew the saying. \"What the king dreams,\" he said, \"the Hand builds.\" \\n\"I bedded a fishmaid once who told me the lowborn have a choicer way to put it. The king eats, they \\nsay, and the Hand takes the shit.\" He threw back his head and roared his laughter. The echoes rang \\nthrough the darkness, and all around them the dead of Winterfell seemed to watch with cold and \\ndisapproving eyes. \\nFinally the laughter dwindled and stopped. Ned was still on one knee, his eyes upraised. \"Damn it, \\nNed,\" the king complained. \"You might at least humor me with a smile.\" \\n\"They say it grows so cold up here in winter that a man\\'s laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to \\ndeath,\" Ned said evenly. \"Perhaps that is why the Starks have so little humor.\" \\n\"Come south with me, and I\\'ll teach you how to laugh again,\" the \\nking promised. \"You helped me win this damnable throne, now help me hold it. We were meant to rule \\ntogether. If Lyanna had lived, we should have been brothers, bound by blood as well as affection. Well, \\nit is not too late. I have a son. You have a daughter. My Joff and your Sansa shall join our houses, as \\n  30\\n\\nLyanna and I might once have done.\" \\nThis offer did surprise him. \"Sansa is only eleven.\" \\nRobert waved an impatient hand. \"Old enough for betrothal. The marriage can wait a few years.\" The \\nking smiled. \"Now stand up and say yes, curse you.\" \\n\"Nothing would give me greater pleasure, Your Grace,\" Ned answered. He hesitated. \"These honors are \\nall so unexpected. May I have some time to consider? I need to tell my wife . . .\" \\n\"Yes, yes, of course, tell Catelyn, sleep on it if you must.\" The king reached down, clasped Ned by the \\nhand, and pulled him roughly to his feet. \"Just don\\'t keep me waiting too long. I am not the most patient \\nof men.\" \\nFor a moment Eddard Stark was filled with a terrible sense of foreboding. This was his place, here in the \\nnorth. He looked at the stone figures all around them, breathed deep in the chill silence of the crypt. He \\ncould feel the eyes of the dead. They were all listening, he knew. And winter was coming. \\nJON \\nThere were times-not many, but a few-when Jon Snow was glad he was a bastard. As he filled his wine \\ncup once more from a passing flagon, it struck him that this might be one of them. \\nHe settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank. The sweet, fruity taste \\nof surnmerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips. \\nThe Great Hall of Winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell of roasted meat and \\nfresh-baked bread. Its grey stone walls were draped with banners. White, gold, crimson: the direwolf of \\nStark, Baratheon\\'s crowned stag, the lion of Lannister. A singer was playing the high harp and reciting a \\nballad, but down at this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire, the \\nclangor of pewter plates and cups, and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations. \\nIt was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king. Jon\\'s brothers and sisters had been seated \\nwith the royal children, beneath the raised platform where Lord and Lady Stark hosted the king and \\nqueen. In honor of the occasion, his lord father would doubtless permit each child a glass of wine, but no \\nmore than that. Down here on the benches, there was no one to stop Jon drinking as much as he had a \\nthirst for. \\nAnd he was finding that he had a man\\'s thirst, to the raucous delight of the youths around him, who urged \\nhim on every time he drained a glass. They were fine company, and Jon relished the stories they were \\ntelling, tales of battle and bedding and the hunt. He was certain that his companions were more \\nentertaining than the king\\'s offspring. He had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their \\nentrance. The procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on the bench, and Jon \\nhad gotten a good long look at them all. \\nHis lord father had come first, escorting the queen. She was as beautiful as men said. A jeweled tiara \\ngleamed amidst her long golden hair, its emeralds a perfect match for the green of her eyes. His father \\nhelped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat, but the queen never so much as looked at him. \\nEven at fourteen, Jon could see through her smile. \\n  31\\n\\nNext had come King Robert himself, with Lady Stark on his arm. The king was a great disappointment \\nto Jon. His father had talked of him often: the peerless Robert Baratheon, demon of the Trident, the \\nfiercest warrior of the realm, a giant among princes. Jon saw only a fat man, red-faced under his beard, \\nsweating through his silks. He walked like a man half in his cups. \\nAfter them came the children. Little Rickon first, managing the long walk with all the dignity a \\nthree-year-old could muster. Jon had to urge him on when he stopped to visit. Close behind came Robb, \\nin grey wool trimmed with white, the Stark colors. He had the Princess Myrcella on his arm. She was a \\nwisp of a girl, not quite eight, her hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net. Jon noticed the shy \\nlooks she gave Robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him. He decided \\nshe was insipid. Robb didn\\'t even have the sense to realize how stupid she was; he was grinning like a \\nfool. \\nHis half sisters escorted the royal princes. Arya was paired with plump young Tommen, whose \\nwhite-blond hair was longer than hers. Sansa, two years older, drew the crown prince, Joffrey \\nBaratheon. He was twelve, younger than Jon or Robb, but taller than either, to Jon\\'s vast dismay. Prince \\nJoffrey had his sister\\'s hair and his mother\\'s deep green eyes. A thick tangle of blond curls dripped down \\npast his golden choker and high velvet collar. Sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him, but Jon \\ndid not like Joffrey\\'s pouty lips or the bored, disdainful way he looked at Winterfell\\'s Great Hall. \\nHe was more interested in the pair that came behind him: the queen\\'s brothers, the Lannisters of Casterly \\nRock. The Lion and the Imp; there was no mistaking which was which. Ser Jaime Lannister was \\ntwin to Queen Cersei; tall and golden, with flashing green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife. He wore \\ncrimson silk, high black boots, a black satin cloak. On the breast of his tunic, the lion of his House was \\nembroidered in gold thread, roaring its defiance. They called him the Lion of Lannister to his face and \\nwhispered \"Kingslayer\" behind his back. \\nJon found it hard to look away from him. This is what a king should look like, he thought to himself as \\nthe man passed. \\nThen he saw the other one, waddling along half-hidden by his brother\\'s side. Tyrion Lannister, the \\nyoungest of Lord Tywin\\'s brood and by far the ugliest. All that the gods had given to Cersei and Jaime, \\nthey had denied Tyrion. He was a dwarf, half his brother\\'s height, struggling to keep pace on stunted legs. \\nHis head was too large for his body, with a brute\\'s squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow. \\nOne green eye and one black one peered out from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed white. Jon \\nwatched him with fascination. \\nThe last of the high lords to enter were his uncle, Benjen Stark of the Night\\'s Watch, and his father\\'s \\nward, young Theon Greyjoy. Benjen gave Jon a warm smile as he went by. Theon ignored him utterly, \\nbut there was nothing new in that. After all had been seated, toasts were made, thanks were given and \\nreturned, and then the feasting began. \\nJon had started drinking then, and he had not stopped. \\nSomething rubbed against his leg beneath the table. Jon saw red eyes staring up at him. \"Hungry again?\" \\nhe asked. There was still half a honeyed chicken in the center of the table. Jon reached out to tear off a \\nleg, then had a better idea. He knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between his \\nlegs. Ghost ripped into it in savage silence. His brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their \\nwolves to the banquet, but there were more curs than Jon could count at this end of the hall, and no one \\n  32\\n\\nhad said a word about his pup. He told himself he was fortunate in that too. \\nHis eyes stung. Jon rubbed at them savagely, cursing the smoke. He swallowed another gulp of wine and \\nwatched his direwolf devour the chicken. \\nDogs moved between the tables, trailing after the serving girls. One of them, a black mongrel bitch with \\nlong yellow eyes, caught a scent of the chicken. She stopped and edged under the bench to get a share. \\nJon watched the confrontation. The bitch growled low in her throat and moved closer. Ghost looked up, \\nsilent, and fixed the dog with those hot red eyes. The bitch snapped an angry challenge. She was three \\ntimes the size of the direwolf pup. Ghost did not move. He stood \\nover his prize and opened his mouth, baring his fangs. The bitch tensed, barked again, then thought \\nbetter of this fight. She turned and slunk away, with one last defiant snap to save her pride. Ghost went \\nback to his meal. \\nJon grinned and reached under the table to ruffle the shaggy white fur. The direwolf looked up at him, \\nnipped gently at his hand, then went back to eating. \\n\"Is this one of the direwolves I\\'ve heard so much of?\" a familiar voice asked close at hand. \\nJon looked up happily as his uncle Ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his hair much as Jon had \\nruffled the wolf s. \"Yes,\" he said. \"His name is Ghost.\" \\nOne of the squires interrupted the bawdy story he\\'d been telling to make room at the table for their lord\\'s \\nbrother. Benjen Stark straddled the bench with,long legs and took the wine cup out of Jon\\'s hand. \\n\"Summerwine,\" he said after a taste. \"Nothing so sweet. How many cups have you had, Jon?\" \\nJon smiled. \\nBen Stark laughed. \"As I feared. Ah, well. I believe I was younger than you the first time I got truly and \\nsincerely drunk.\" He snagged a roasted onion, dripping brown with gravy, from a nearby trencher and bit \\ninto it. It crunched. \\nHis uncle was sharp-featured and gaunt as a mountain crag, but there was always a hint of laughter in his \\nblue-grey eyes. He dressed in black, as befitted a man of the Night\\'s Watch. Tonight it was rich black \\nvelvet, with high leather boots and a wide belt with a silver buckle. A heavy silver chain was looped \\nround his neck. Benjen watched Ghost with amusement as he ate his onion. \"A very quiet wolf,\" he \\nobserved. \\n\"He\\'s not like the others,\" Jon said. \"He never makes a sound. That\\'s why I named him Ghost. That, and \\nbecause he\\'s white. The others are all dark, grey or black.\" \\n\"There are still direwolves beyond the Wall. We hear them on our rangings.\" Benjen Stark gave Jon a \\nlong look. \"Don\\'t you usually eat at table with your brothers?\" \\n\"Most times,\" Jon answered in a flat voice. \"But tonight Lady Stark thought it might give insult to the \\nroyal family to seat a bastard among them.\" \\n\"I see.\" His uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall. \"My brother \\ndoes not seem very festive tonight.\" \\n  33\\n\\nJon had noticed that too. A bastard had to learn to notice things, to read the truth that people hid behind \\ntheir eyes. His father was observing \\nall the courtesies, but there was tightness in him that Jon had seldom seen before. He said little, \\nlooking out over the hall with hooded eyes, seeing nothing. Two seats away, the king had been drinking \\nheavily all night. His broad face was flushed behind his great black beard. He made many a toast, \\nlaughed loudly at every jest, and attacked each dish like a starving man, but beside him the queen seemed \\nas cold as an ice sculpture. \"The queen is angry too,\" Jon told his uncle in a low, quiet voice. \"Father took \\nthe king down to the crypts this afternoon. The queen didn\\'t want him to go.\" \\nBenjen gave Jon a careful, measuring look. \"You don\\'t miss much, do you, Jon? We could use a man \\nlike you on the Wall.\" \\nJon swelled with pride. \"Robb is a stronger lance than I am, but I\\'m the better sword, and Hullen says I \\nsit a horse as well as anyone in the castle.\" \\n\"Notable achievements.\" \\n\"Take me with you when you go back to the Wall,\" Jon said in a sudden rush. \"Father will give me leave \\nto go if you ask him, I know he will.\" \\nUncle Benjen studied his face carefully. \"The Wall is a hard place for a boy, Jon.\" \\n\"I am almost a man grown,\" Jon protested. \"I will turn fifteen on my next name day, and Maester Luwin \\nsays bastards grow up faster than other children.\" \\n\"That\\'s true enough,\" Benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth. He took Jon\\'s cup from the table, \\nfilled it fresh from a nearby pitcher, and drank down a long swallow. \\n\"Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne,\" Jon said. The Young Dragon was \\none of his heroes. \\n\"A conquest that lasted a summer,\" his uncle pointed out. \"Your Boy King lost ten thousand men taking \\nthe place, and another fifty trying to hold it. Someone should have told him that war isn\\'t a game.\" He \\ntook another sip of wine. \"Also,\" he said, wiping his mouth, \"Daeren Targaryen was only eighteen when \\nhe died. Or have you forgotten that part?\" \\n\"I forget nothing,\" Jon boasted. The wine was making him bold. He tried to sit very straight, to make \\nhimself seem taller. \"I want to serve in the Night\\'s Watch, Uncle.\" \\nHe had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him. Robb would \\nsomeday inherit Winterfell, would command great armies as the Warden of the North. Bran and Rickon \\nwould be Robb\\'s bannermen and rule holdfasts in his name. His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the \\nheirs of other great houses \\nand go south as mistress of castles of their own. But what place could a bastard hope to earn? \\n\"You don\\'t know what you\\'re asking, Jon. The Night\\'s Watch is a sworn brotherhood. We have no \\nfamilies. None of us will ever father sons. Our wife is duty. Our mistress is honor.\" \\n\"A bastard can have honor too,\" Jon said. \"I am ready to swear your oath.\" \\n  34\\n\\n\"You are a boy of fourteen,\" Benjen said. \"Not a man, not yet. Until you have known a woman, you \\ncannot understand what you would be giving up.\" \\n\"I don\\'t care about that!\" Jon said hotly. \\n\"You might, if you knew what it meant,\" Benjen said. \"If you knew what the oath would cost you, you \\nmight be less eager to pay the price, son.\" \\nJon felt anger rise inside him. \"I\\'m not your son!\" \\nBenjen Stark stood up. \"More\\'s the pity.\" He put a hand on Jon\\'s shoulder. \"Come back to me after \\nyou\\'ve fathered a few bastards of your own, and we\\'ll see how you feel.\" \\nJon trembled. \"I will never father a bastard,\" he said carefully. \"Never!\" He spat it out like venom. \\nSuddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent, and they were all looking at him. He felt the tears \\nbegin to well behind his eyes. He pushed himself to his feet. \\n\"I must be excused,\" he said with the last of his dignity. He whirled and bolted before they could see him \\ncry. He must have drunk more wine than he had realized. His feet got tangled under him as he tried to \\nleave, and he lurched sideways into a serving girl and sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor. \\nLaughter boomed all around him, and Jon felt hot tears on his cheeks. Someone tried to steady him. He \\nwrenched free of their grip and ran, half-blind, for the door. Ghost followed close at his heels, out into the \\nnight. \\nThe yard was quiet and empty. A lone sentry stood high on the battlements of the inner wall, his cloak \\npulled tight around him against the cold. He looked bored and miserable as he huddled there alone, but \\nJon would have traded places with him in an instant. Otherwise the castle was dark and deserted. Jon \\nhad seen an abandoned holdfast once, a drear place where nothing moved but the wind and the stones \\nkept silent about whatever people had lived there. Winterfell reminded him of that tonight. \\nThe sounds of music and song spilled through the open windows behind him. They were the last things \\nJon wanted to hear. He wiped \\naway his tears on the sleeve of his shirt, furious that he had let them fall, and turned to go. \\n\"Boy,\" a voice called out to him. Jon turned. \\nTyrion Lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the Great Hall, looking for all the world like \\na gargoyle. The dwarf grinned down at him. \"Is that animal a wolf?\" \\n\"A direwolf,\" Jon said. \"His name is Ghost.\" He stared up at the little man, his disappointment suddenly \\nforgotten. \"What are you doing up there? Why aren\\'t you at the feast?\" \\n\"Too hot, too noisy, and I\\'d drunk too much wine,\" the dwarf told him. \"I learned long ago that it is \\nconsidered rude to vomit on your brother. Might I have a closer look at your wolf?\" \\nJon hesitated, then nodded slowly. \"Can you climb down, or shall I bring a ladder?\" \\n\"Oh, bleed that,\" the little man said. He pushed himself off the ledge into empty air. Jon gasped, then \\n  35\\n\\nwatched with awe as Tyrion Lannister spun around in a tight ball, landed lightly on his hands, then vaulted \\nbackward onto his legs. \\nGhost backed away from him uncertainly. \\nThe dwarf dusted himself off and laughed. \"I believe I\\'ve frightened your wolf. My apologies.\" \\n\"He\\'s not scared,\" Jon said. He knelt and called out. \"Ghost, come here. Come on. That\\'s it.\" \\nThe wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at Jon\\'s face, but he kept a wary eye on Tyrion Lannister, and \\nwhen the dwarf reached out to pet him, he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl. \"Shy, isn\\'t he?\" \\nLannister observed. \\n\"Sit, Ghost,\" Jon commanded. \"That\\'s it. Keep still.\" He looked up at the dwarf. \"You can touch him \\nnow. He won\\'t move until I tell him to. I\\'ve been training him.\" \\n\"I see,\" Lannister said. He ruffled the snow-white fur between Ghost\\'s ears and said, \"Nice wolf.\" \\n\"If I wasn\\'t here, he\\'d tear out your throat,\" Jon said. It wasn\\'t actually true yet, but it would be. \\n\"In that case, you had best stay close,\" the dwarf said. He cocked his oversized head to one side and \\nlooked Jon over with his mismatched eyes. \"I am Tyrion Lannister.\" \\n\"I know,\" Jon said. He rose. Standing, he was taller than the dwarf. It made him feel strange. \\n\"You\\'re Ned Stark\\'s bastard, aren\\'t you?\" \\nJon felt a coldness pass right through him. He pressed his lips together and said nothing. \\n\"Did I offend you?\" Lannister said. \"Sorry. Dwarfs don\\'t have to be tactful. Generations of capering fools \\nin motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head.\" He \\ngrinned. \"You are the bastard, though.\" \\n\"Lord Eddard Stark is my father,\" Jon admitted stiffly. \\nLannister studied his face. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I can see it. You have more of the north in you than your \\nbrothers.\" \\n\"Half brothers,\" Jon corrected. He was pleased by the dwarf s comment, but he tried not to let it show. \\n\"Let me give you some counsel, bastard,\" Lannister said. \"Never forget what you are, for surely the \\nworld will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it \\nwill never be used to hurt you.\" \\nJon was in no mood for anyone\\'s counsel. \"What do you know about being a bastard?\" \\n\"All dwarfs are bastards in their father\\'s eyes.\" \\n\"You are your mother\\'s trueborn son of Lannister.\" \\n\"Am I\" the dwarf replied, sardonic. \"Do tell my lord father. MY mother died birthing me, and he\\'s never \\n  36\\n\\nbeen sure.\" \\n\"I don\\'t even know who my mother was,\" Jon said. \\n\"Some woman, no doubt. Most of them are.\" He favored Jon with a rueful grin. \"Remember this, boy. \\nAll dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs.\" And with that he turned and sauntered \\nback into the feast, whistling a tune. When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow \\nclear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king. \\nCATELYN \\n0f all the rooms in Winterfell\\'s Great Keep, Catelyn\\'s bedchambers were the hottest. She seldom had to \\nlight a fire. The castle had been built over natural hot springs, and the scalding waters rushed through its \\nwalls and chambers like blood through a man\\'s body, driving the chill from the stone halls, filling the glass \\ngardens with a moist warmth, keeping the earth from freezing. Open pools smoked day and night in a \\ndozen small courtyards. That was a little thing, in summer; in winter, it was the difference between life and \\ndeath. \\nCatelyn\\'s bath was always hot and steaming, and her walls warm to the touch. The warmth reminded her \\nof Riverrun, of days in the sun with Lysa and Edmure, but Ned could never abide the heat. The Starks \\nwere made for the cold, he would tell her, and she would laugh and tell him in that case they had certainly \\nbuilt their castle in the wrong place. \\nSo when they had finished, Ned rolled off and climbed from her bed, as he had a thousand times before. \\nHe crossed the room, pulled back the heavy tapestries, and threw open the high narrow windows one by \\none, letting the night air into the chamber. \\nThe wind swirled around him as he stood facing the dark, naked and empty-handed. Catelyn pulled the \\nfurs to her chin and watched him. He looked somehow smaller and more vulnerable, like the youth she \\nhad wed in the sept at Riverrun, fifteen long years gone. Her loins \\nstill ached from the urgency of his lovernaking. It was a good ache. She could feel his seed within her. \\nShe prayed that it might quicken there. It had been three years since Rickon. She was not too old. She \\ncould give him another son. \\n\"I will refuse him,\" Ned said as he turned back to her. His eyes were haunted, his voice thick with doubt. \\nCatelyn sat up in the bed. \"You cannot. You must not.\" \\n\"My duties are here in the north. I have no wish to be Robert\\'s Hand.\" \\n\"He will not understand that. He is a king now, and kings are not like other men. If you refuse to serve \\nhim, he will wonder why, and sooner or later he will begin to suspect that you oppose him. Can\\'t you see \\nthe danger that would put us in?\" \\nNed shook his head, refusing to believe. \"Robert would never harm me or any of mine. We were closer \\nthan brothers. He loves me. If I refuse him, he will roar and curse and bluster, and in a week we will \\nlaugh about it together. I know the man!\" \\n  37\\n\\n\"You knew the man,\" she said. \"The king is a stranger to you.\" Catelyn remembered the direwolf dead in \\nthe snow, the broken antler lodged deep in her throat. She had to make him see. \"Pride is everything to a \\nking, my lord. Robert came all this way to see you, to bring you these great honors, you cannot throw \\nthem back in his face.\" \\n\"Honors?\" Ned laughed bitterly. \\n\"In his eyes, yes,\" she said. \\n\"And in yours?\" \\n\"And in mine,\" she blazed, angry now. Why couldn\\'t he see? \"He offers his own son in marriage to our \\ndaughter, what else would you call that? Sansa might someday be queen. Her sons could rule from the \\nWall to the mountains of Dorne. What is so wrong with that?\" \\n\"Gods, Catelyn, Sansa is only eleven,\" Ned said. \"And Joffrey . . . Joffrey is . . .\" \\nShe finished for him. crown prince, and heir to the Iron Throne. And I was only twelve when my father \\npromised me to your brother Brandon.\" \\nThat brought a bitter twist to Ned\\'s mouth. \"Brandon. Yes. Brandon would know what to do. He \\nalways did. It was all meant for Brandon. You, Winterfell, everything. He was born to be a King\\'s Hand \\nand a father to queens. I never asked for this cup to pass to me.\" \\n\"Perhaps not,\" Catelyn said, \"but Brandon is dead, and the cup has passed, and you must drink from it, \\nlike it or not.\" \\nNed turned away from her, back to the night. He stood staring out \\nin the darkness, watching the moon and the stars perhaps, or perhaps the sentries on the wall. \\nCatelyn softened then, to see his pain. Eddard Stark had married her in Brandon\\'s place, as custom \\ndecreed, but the shadow of his dead brother still lay between them, as did the other, the shadow of the \\nwoman he would not name, the woman who had borne him his bastard son. \\nShe was about to go to him when the knock came at the door, loud and unexpected. Ned turned, \\nfrowning. \"What is it?\" \\nDesmond\\'s voice came through the door. \"My lord, Maester Luwin is without and begs urgent \\naudience.\" \\n\"You told him I had left orders not to be disturbed?\" \\n\"Yes, my lord. He insists.\" \\n\"Very well. Send him in.\" \\nNed crossed to the wardrobe and slipped on a heavy robe. Catelyn realized suddenly how cold it had \\nbecome. She sat up in bed and pulled the furs to her chin. \"Perhaps we should close the windows,\" she \\nsuggested. \\n  38\\n\\nNed nodded absently. Maester Luwin was shown in. \\nThe maester was a small grey man. His eyes were grey, and quick, and saw much. His hair was grey, \\nwhat little the years had left him. His robe was grey wool, trimmed with white fur, the Stark colors. Its \\ngreat floppy sleeves had pockets hidden inside. Luwin was always tucking things into those sleeves and \\nproducing other things from them: books, messages, strange artifacts, toys for the children. With all he \\nkept hidden in his sleeves, Catelyn was surprised that Maester Luwin could lift his arms at all. \\nThe maester waited until the door had closed behind him before he spoke. \"My lord,\" he said to Ned, \\n\"pardon for disturbing your rest. I have been left a message.\" \\nNed looked irritated. \"Been left? By whom? Has there been a rider? I was not told.\" \\n\"There was no rider, my lord. Only a carved wooden box, left on a table in my observatory while I \\nnapped. My servants saw no one, but it must have been brought by someone in the king\\'s party. We \\nhave had no other visitors from the south.\" \\n\"A wooden box, you say?\" Catelyn said. \\n\"Inside was a fine new lens for the observatory, from Myr by the look of it. The lenscrafters of Myr are \\nwithout equal.\" \\nNed frowned. He had little patience for this sort of thing, Catelyn knew. \"A lens,\" he said. \"What has \\nthat to do with me?\" \\n\"I asked the same question,\" Maester Luwin said. \"Clearly there was more to this than the seeming.\" \\nUnder the heavy weight of her furs, Catelyn shivered. \"A lens is an instrument to help us see.\" \\n\"Indeed it is.\" He fingered the collar of his order; a heavy chain worn tight around the neck beneath his \\nrobe, each link forged from a different metal. \\nCatelyn could feel dread stirring inside her once again. \"What is it that they would have us see more \\nclearly?\" \\n\"The very thing I asked myself.\" Maester Luwin drew a tightly rolled paper out of his sleeve. \"I found the \\ntrue message concealed within a false bottom when I dismantled the box the lens had come in, but it is \\nnot for my eyes.\" \\nNed held out his hand. \"Let me have it, then.\" \\nLuwin did not stir. \"Pardons, my lord. The message is not for you either. It is marked for the eyes of the \\nLady Catelyn, and her alone. May I approach?\" \\nCatelyn nodded, not trusting to speak. The maester placed the paper on the table beside the bed. It was \\nsealed with a small blob of blue wax. Luwin bowed and began to retreat. \\n\"Stay,\" Ned commanded him. His voice was grave. He looked at Catelyn. \"What is it? My lady, you\\'re \\nshaking.\" \\n\"I\\'m afraid,\" she admitted. She reached out and took the letter in trembling hands. The furs dropped \\n  39\\n\\naway from her nakedness, forgotten. In the blue wax was the moon-and-falcon seal of House Arryn. \"It\\'s \\nfrom Lysa.\" Catelyn looked at her husband. \"It will not make us glad,\" she told him. \"There is grief in this \\nmessage, Ned. I can feel it.\" \\nNed frowned, his face darkening. \"Open it.\" \\nCatelyn broke the seal. \\nHer eyes moved over the words. At first they made no sense to her. Then she remembered. \"Lysa took \\nno chances. When we were girls together, we had a private language, she and L\" \\n\"Can you read it?\" \\n\"Yes,\" Catelyn admitted. \\n\"Then tell us.\" \\n\"Perhaps I should withdraw,\" Maester Luwin said. \\n\"No,\" Catelyn said. \"We will need your counsel.\" She threw back the furs and climbed from the bed. \\nThe night air was as cold as the grave on her bare skin as she padded across the room. \\nMaester Luwin averted his eyes. Even Ned looked shocked. \"What are you doing?\" he asked. \\n\"Lighting a fire,\" Catelyn told him. She found a dressing gown and shrugged into it, then knelt over the \\ncold hearth. \\n\"Maester Luwin-\" Ned began. \\n\"Maester Luwin has delivered all my children,\" Catelyn said. \"This is no time for false modesty.\" She slid \\nthe paper in among the kindling and placed the heavier logs on top of it. \\nNed crossed the room, took her by the arm, and pulled her to her feet. He held her there, his face inches \\nfrom her. \"My lady, tell me! What was this message?\" \\nCatelyn stiffened in his grasp. \"A warning,\" she said softly. \"If we have the wits to hear.\" \\nHis eyes searched her face. \"Go on.\" \\n\"Lysa says Jon Arryn was murdered.\" \\nHis fingers tightened on her arm. \"By whom?\" \\n\"The Lannisters,\" she told him. \"The queen.\" \\nNed released his hold on her arm. There were deep red marks on her skin. \"Gods,\" he whispered. His \\nvoice was hoarse. \"Your sister is sick with grief. She cannot know what she is saying.\" \\n\"She knows,\" Catelyn said. \"Lysa is impulsive, yes, but this message was carefully planned, cleverly \\nhidden. She knew it meant death if her letter fell into the wrong hands. To risk so much, she must have \\nhad more than mere suspicion.\" Catelyn looked to her husband. \"Now we truly have no choice. You \\n  40\\n\\nmust be Robert\\'s Hand. You must go south with him and learn the truth.\" \\nShe saw at once that Ned had reached a very different conclusion. \"The only truths I know are here. \\nThe south is a nest of adders I would do better to avoid.\" \\nLuwin plucked at his chain collar where it had chafed the soft skin of his throat. \"The Hand of the King \\nhas great power, my lord. Power to find the truth of Lord Arryn\\'s death, to bring his killers to the king\\'s \\njustice. Power to protect Lady Arryn and her son, if the worst be true.\" \\nNed glanced helplessly around the bedchamber. Catelyn\\'s heart went out to him, but she knew she \\ncould not take him in her arms just then. First the victory must be won, for her children\\'s sake. \"You say \\nyou love Robert like a brother. Would you leave your brother surrounded by Lannisters?\" \\n\"The Others take both of you,\" Ned muttered darkly. He turned away from them and went to the \\nwindow. She did not speak, nor did the maester. They waited, quiet, while Eddard Stark said a silent \\nfarewell to the home he loved. When he turned away from the window at last, his voice was tired and full \\nof melancholy, and moisture glittered \\nfaintly in the corners of his eyes. \"My father went south once, to answer the summons of a king. He \\nnever came home again.\" \\n\"A different time,\" Maester Luwin said. \"A different king.\" \\n\"Yes,\" Ned said dully. He seated himself in a chair by the hearth. \"Catelyn, you shall stay here in \\nWinterfell.\" \\nHis words were like an icy draft through her heart. \"No,\" she said, suddenly afraid. Was this to be her \\npunishment? Never to see his face again, nor to feel his arms around her? \\n\"Yes,\" Ned said, in words that would brook no argument. \"You must govern the north in my stead, while \\nI run Robert\\'s errands. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. Robb is fourteen. Soon enough, he \\nwill be a man grown. He must learn to rule, and I will not be here for him. Make him part of your \\ncouncils. He must be ready when his time comes.\" \\n\"Gods will, not for many years,\" Maester Luwin murmured. \\n\"Maester Luwin, I trust you as I would my own blood. Give my wife your voice in all things great and \\nsmall. Teach my son the things he needs to know. Winter is coming.\" \\nMaester Luwin nodded gravely. Then silence fell, until Catelyn found her courage and asked the \\nquestion whose answer she most dreaded. \"What of the other children?\" \\nNed stood, and took her in his arms, and held her face close to his. \"Rickon is very young,\" he said \\ngently. \"He should stay here with you and Robb. The others I would take with me.\" \\n\"I could not bear it,\" Catelyn said, trembling. \\n\"You must,\" he said. \"Sansa must wed Joffrey, that is clear now, we must give them no grounds to \\nsuspect our devotion. And it is past time that Arya learned the ways of a southron court. In a few years \\nshe will be of an age to marry too.\" \\n  41\\n\\nSansa would shine in the south, Catelyn thought to herself, and the gods knew that Arya needed \\nrefinement. Reluctantly, she let go of them in her heart. But not Bran. Never Bran. \"Yes,\" she said, \"but \\nplease, Ned, for the love you bear me, let Bran remain here at Winterfell. He is only seven.\" \\n\"I was eight when my father sent me to foster at the Eyrie,\" Ned said. \"Ser Rodrik tells me there is bad \\nfeeling between Robb and Prince Joffrey. That is not healthy. Bran can bridge that distance. He is a \\nsweet boy, quick to laugh, easy to love. Let him grow up with the young princes, let him become their \\nfriend as Robert became mine. Our House will be the safer for it.\" \\nHe was right; Catelyn knew it. It did not make the pain any easier to bear. She would lose all four of \\nthem, then: Ned, and both girls, and \\nher sweet, loving Bran. Only Robb and little Rickon would be left to her. She felt lonely already. \\nWinterfell was such a vast place. \"Keep him off the walls, then,\" she said bravely. \"You know how Bran \\nloves to climb.\" \\nNed kissed the tears from her eyes before they could fall. \"Thank you, my lady,\" he whispered. \"This is \\nhard, I know.\" \\n\"What of Jon Snow, my lord?\" Maester Luwin asked. \\nCatelyn tensed at the mention of the name. Ned felt the anger in her, and pulled away. \\nMany men fathered bastards. Catelyn had grown up with that knowledge. It came as no surprise to her, \\nin the first year of her marriage, to learn that Ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met on \\ncampaign. He had a man\\'s needs, after all, and they had spent that year apart, Ned off at war in the south \\nwhile she remained safe in her father\\'s castle at Riverrun. Her thoughts were more of Robb, the infant at \\nher breast, than of the husband she scarcely knew. He was welcome to whatever solace he might find \\nbetween battles. And if his seed quickened, she expected he would see to the child\\'s needs. \\nHe did more than that. The Starks were not like other men. Ned brought his bastard home with him, and \\ncalled him \"son\" for all the north to see. When the wars were over at last, and Catelyn rode to Winterfell, \\nJon and his wet nurse had already taken up residence. \\nThat cut deep. Ned would not speak of the mother, not so much as a word, but a castle has no secrets, \\nand Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husband\\'s soldiers. They \\nwhispered of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys\\'s \\nKingsguard, and of how their young lord had slain him in single combat. And they told how afterward \\nNed had carried Ser Arthur\\'s sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called \\nStarfall on the shores of the Summer Sea. The Lady Ashara Dayne, tall and fair, with haunting violet \\neyes. It had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage, but finally, in bed one night, Catelyn had asked \\nher husband the truth of it, asked him to his face. \\nThat was the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her. \"Never ask me about Jon,\" he \\nsaid, cold as ice. \"He is my blood, and that is all you need to know. And now I will learn where you \\nheard that name, my lady.\" She had pledged to obey; she told him; and from that day on, the whispering \\nhad stopped, and Ashara Dayne\\'s name was never heard in Winterfell again. \\nWhoever Jon\\'s mother had been, Ned must have loved her fiercely, for nothing Catelyn said would \\npersuade him to send the boy away. It \\n  42\\n\\nwas the one thing she could never forgive him. She had come to love her husband with all her heart, but \\nshe had never found it in her to love Jon. She might have overlooked a dozen bastards for Ned\\'s sake, \\nso long as they were out of sight. Jon was never out of sight, and as he grew, he looked more like Ned \\nthan any of the trueborn sons she bore him. Somehow that made it worse. \"Jon must go,\" she said now. \\n\"He and Robb are close,\" Ned said. \"I had hoped . . .\" \\n\"He cannot stay here,\" Catelyn said, cutting him off. \"He is your son, not mine. I will not have him.\" It \\nwas hard, she knew, but no less the truth. Ned would do the boy no kindness by leaving him here at \\nWinterfell. \\nThe look Ned gave her was anguished. \"You know I cannot take him south. There will be no place for \\nhim at court. A boy with a bastard\\'s name . . . you know what they will say of him. He will be shunned.\" \\nCatelyn armored her heart against the mute appeal in her husband\\'s eyes. \"They say your friend Robert \\nhas fathered a dozen bastards himself.\" \\n\"And none of them has ever been seen at court!\" Ned blazed. \"The Lann.ister woman has seen to that. \\nHow can you be so damnably cruel, Catelyn? He is only a boy. He-\" \\nHis fury was on him. He might have said more, and worse, but Maester Luwin cut in. \"Another solution \\npresents itself,\" he said, his voice quiet. \"Your brother Benjen came to me about Jon a few days ago. It \\nseems the boy aspires to take the black.\" \\nNed looked shocked. \"He asked to join the Night\\'s Watch?\" \\nCatelyn said nothing. Let Ned work it out in his own mind; her voice would not be welcome now. Yet \\ngladly would she have kissed the maester just then. His was the perfect solution. Benjen Stark was a \\nSworn Brother. Jon would be a son to him, the child he would never have. And in time the boy would \\ntake the oath as well. He would father no sons who might someday contest with Catelyn\\'s own \\ngrandchildren for Winterfell. \\nMaester Luwin said, \"There is great honor in service on the Wall, my lord.\" \\n\"And even a bastard may rise high in the Night\\'s Watch,\" Ned reflected. Still, his voice was troubled. \\n\"Jon is so young. If he asked this when he was a man grown, that would be one thing, but a boy of \\nfourteen . . .\" \\n\"A hard sacrifice,\" Maester Luwin agreed. \"Yet these are hard times, my lord. His road is no crueler \\nthan yours or your lady\\'s.11 \\nCatelyn thought of the three children she must lose. It was not easy keeping silent then. \\nNed turned away from them to gaze out the window, his long face silent and thoughtful. Finally he \\nsighed, and turned back. \"Very well,\" he said to Maester Luwin. \"I suppose it is for the best. I will speak \\nto Ben.\" \\n\"When shall we tell Jon?\" the maester asked. \\n\"When I must. Preparations must be made. It will be a fortnight before we are ready to depart. I would \\nsooner let Jon enjoy these last few days. Summer will end soon enough, and childhood as well. When the \\n  43\\n\\ntime comes, I will tell him myself.\" \\nARYA \\nA rya\\'s stitches were crooked again. \\nShe frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other \\ngirls. Sansa\\'s needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. \"Sansa\\'s work is as pretty as she is,\" Septa \\nMordane told their lady mother once. \"She has such fine, delicate hands.\" When Lady Catelyn had asked \\nabout Arya, the septa had sniffed. \"Arya has the hands of a blacksmith.\" \\nArya glanced furtively across the room, worried that Septa Mordane might have read her thoughts, but \\nthe septa was paying her no attention today. She was sitting with the Princess Myrcella, all smiles and \\nadmiration. It was not often that the septa was privileged to instruct a royal princess in the womanly arts, \\nas she had said when the queen brought Myrcella to join them. Arya thought that Myrcella\\'s stitches \\nlooked a little crooked too, but you would never know it from the way Septa Mordane was cooing. \\nShe studied her own work again, looking for some way to salvage it, then sighed and put down the \\nneedle. She looked glumly at her sister. Sansa was chatting away happily as she worked. Beth Cassel, \\nSer Rodrik\\'s little girl, was sitting by her feet, listening to every word she said, and Jeyne Poole was \\nleaning over to whisper something in her ear. \\n\"What are you talking about?\" Arya asked suddenly. \\nJeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. Sansa looked abashed. Beth blushed. No one answered. \\n\"Tell me,\" Arya said. \\nJeyne glanced over to make certain that Septa Mordane was not listening. Myrcella said something then, \\nand the septa laughed along with the rest of the ladies. \\n\"We were talking about the prince,\" Sansa said, her voice soft as a kiss. \\nArya knew which prince she meant: Jofftey, of course. The tall, handsome one. Sansa got to sit with him \\nat the feast. Arya had to sit with the little fat one. Naturally. \\n\"Joffrey likes your sister,\" Jeyne whispered, proud as if she had something to do with it. She was the \\ndaughter of Winterfell\\'s steward and Sansa\\'s dearest friend. \"He told her she was very beautiful.\" \\n\"He\\'s going to marry her,\" little Beth said dreamily, hugging herself. \"Then Sansa will be queen of all the \\nrealm.\" \\nSansa had the grace to blush. She blushed prettily. She did everything prettily, Arya thought with dull \\nresentment. \"Beth, you shouldn\\'t make up stories,\" Sansa corrected the younger girl, gently stroking her \\nhair to take the harshness out of her words. She looked at Arya. \"What did you think of Prince Joff, \\nsister? He\\'s very gallant, don\\'t you think?\" \\n\"Jon says he looks like a girl,\" Arya said. \\n  44\\n\\nSansa sighed as she stitched. \"Poor Jon,\" she said. \"He gets jealous because he\\'s a bastard.\" \\n\"He\\'s our brother,\" Arya said, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower \\nroom. \\nSepta Mordane raised her eyes. She had a bony face, sharp eyes, and a thin lipless mouth made for \\nfrowning. It was frowning now. \"What are you talking about, children?\" \\n\"Our half brother,\" Sansa corrected, soft and precise. She smiled for the septa. \"Arya and I were \\nremarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with us today,\" she said. \\nSepta Mordane nodded. \"Indeed. A great honor for us all.\" Princess Myrcella smiled uncertainly at the \\ncompliment. \"Arya, why aren\\'t you at work?\" the septa asked. She rose to her feet, starched skirts \\nrustling as she started across the room. \"Let me see your stitches.\" \\nArya wanted to scream. It was just like Sansa to go and attract the septa\\'s attention. \"Here,\" she said, \\nsurrendering up her work. \\nThe septa examined the fabric. \"Arya, Arya, Arya,\" she said. \"This will not do. This will not do at all.\" \\nEveryone was looking at her. It was too much. Sansa was too well bred to smile at her sister\\'s disgrace, \\nbut Jeyne was smirking on her \\nbehalf. Even Princess Myrcella looked sorry for her. Arya felt tears filling her eyes. She pushed herself \\nout of her chair and bolted for the door. \\nSepta Mordane called after her. \"Arya, come back here! Don\\'t you take another step! Your lady mother \\nwill hear of this. In front of our royal princess too! You\\'ll shame us all!\" \\nArya stopped at the door and turned back, biting her lip. The tears were running down her cheeks now. \\nShe managed a stiff little bow to Myrcella. \"By your leave, my lady.\" \\nMyrcella blinked at her and looked to her ladies for guidance. But if she was uncertain, Septa Mordane \\nwas not. \"Just where do you think you are going, Arya?\" the septa demanded. \\nArya glared at her. \"I have to go shoe a horse,\" she said sweetly, taking a brief satisfaction in the shock \\non the septa\\'s face. Then she whirled and made her exit, running down the steps as fast as her feet would \\ntake her. \\nIt wasn\\'t fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born, \\nthere had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. Sansa could sew and dance and sing. She wrote \\npoetry. She knew how to dress. She played the high harp and the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa \\nhad gotten their mother\\'s fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took after \\ntheir lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call \\nher Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near. It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better \\nthan her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household. Sansa had never had much of a \\nhead for figures. If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward. \\nNymeria was waiting for her in the guardroom at the base of the stairs. She bounded to her feet as soon \\nas she caught sight of Arya. Arya grinned. The wolf pup loved her, even if no one else did. They went \\neverywhere together, and Nymeria slept in her room, at the foot of her bed. If Mother had not forbidden \\n  45\\n\\nit, Arya would gladly have taken the wolf with her to needlework. Let Septa Mordane complain about \\nher stitches then. \\nNymeria nipped eagerly at her hand as Arya untied her. She had yellow eyes. When they caught the \\nsunlight, they gleamed like two golden coins. Arya had named her after the warrior queen of the Rhoyne, \\nwho had led her people across the narrow sea. That had been a great scandal too. Sansa, of course, had \\nnamed her pup \"Lady.\" Arya made a face and hugged the wolfling tight. Nymeria licked her ear, and she \\ngiggled. \\nBy now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother. If she went to her room, \\nthey would find her. Arya did not care to be found. She had a better notion. The boys were at practice in \\nthe yard. She wanted to see Robb put gallant Prince Joffrey flat on his back. \"Come,\" she whispered to \\nNymeria. She got up and ran, the wolf coming hard at her heels. \\nThere was a window in the covered bridge between the armory and the Great Keep where you had a \\nview of the whole yard. That was where they headed. \\nThey arrived, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up languidly to his chin. \\nHe was watching the action, so absorbed that he seemed unaware of her approach until his white wolf \\nmoved to meet them. Nymeria stalked closer on wary feet. Ghost, already larger than his litter mates, \\nsmelled her, gave her ear a careful nip, and settled back down. \\nJon gave her a curious look. \"Shouldn\\'t you be working on your stitches, little sister?\" \\nArya made a face at him. \"I wanted to see them fight.\" \\nHe smiled. \"Come here, then.\" \\nArya climbed up on the window and sat beside him, to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard \\nbelow. \\nTo her disappointment, it was the younger boys drilling. Bran was so heavily padded he looked as \\nthough he had belted on a featherbed, and Prince Tommen, who was plump to begin with, seemed \\npositively round. They were huffing and puffing and hitting at each other with padded wooden swords \\nunder the watchful eye of old Ser Rodrik Cassel, the master-at-arms, a great stout keg of a man with \\nmagnificent white cheek whiskers. A dozen spectators, man and boy, were calling out encouragement, \\nRobb\\'s voice the loudest among them. She spotted Theon Greyjoy beside him, his black doublet \\nemblazoned with the golden kraken of his House, a look of wry contempt on his face. Both of the \\ncombatants were staggering. Arya judged that they had been at it awhile. \\n\"A shade more exhausting than needlework,\" Jon observed. \\n\"A shade more fun than needlework,\" Arya gave back at him. Jon grinned, reached over, and messed up \\nher hair. Arya flushed. They had always been close. Jon had their father\\'s face, as she did. They were the \\nonly ones. Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and \\nfire in their hair. When Arya had been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too. It \\nbeen Jon she had gone to in her fear, and Jon who had reassured her. \\n64 GEORGL R.R. MARTIN \\n\"Why aren\\'t you down in the yard?\" Arya asked him. \\n  46\\n\\nHe gave her a half smile. \"Bastards are not allowed to damage young princes,\" he said. \"Any bruises \\nthey take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords.\" \\n\"Oh.\" Arya felt abashed. She should have realized. For the second time today, Arya reflected that life \\nwas not fair. \\nShe watched her little brother whack at Tommen. \"I could do just as good as Bran,\" she said. \"He\\'s only \\nseven. I\\'m nine.\" \\nJon looked her over with all his fourteen-year-old wisdom. \"You\\'re too skinny,\" he said. He took her \\narm to feel her muscle. Then he sighed and shook his head. \"I doubt you could even lift a longsword, little \\nsister, never mind swing one.\" \\nArya snatched back her arm and glared at him. Jon messed up her hair again. They watched Bran and \\nTommen circle each other. \\n\"You see Prince Joffrey?\" Jon asked. \\nShe hadn\\'t, not at first glance, but when she looked again she found him to the back, under the shade of \\nthe high stone wall. He was surrounded by men she did not recognize, young squires in the livery of \\nLannister and Baratheon, strangers all. There were a few older men among them; knights, she surmised. \\n\"Look at the arms on his surcoat,\" Jon suggested. \\nArya looked. An ornate shield had been embroidered on the prince\\'s padded surcoat. No doubt the \\nneedlework was exquisite. The arms were divided down the middle; on one side was the crowned stag \\nof the royal House, on the other the lion of Lannister. \\n\"The Lannisters are proud,\" Jon observed. \"You\\'d think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no. He \\nmakes his mother\\'s House equal in honor to the king\\'s.\" \\n\"The woman is important too!\" Arya protested. \\nJon chuckled. \"Perhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed Tully to Stark in your arms.\" \\n\"A wolf with a fish in its mouth?\" It made her laugh. \"That would look silly. Besides, if a girl can\\'t fight, \\nwhy should she have a coat of arms?\" \\nJon shrugged. \"Girls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords but not the arms. I did not \\nmake the rules, little sister.\" \\nThere was a shout from the courtyard below. Prince Tommen was rolling in the dust, trying to get up and \\nfailing. All the padding made him look like a turtle on its back. Bran was standing over him with upraised \\nwooden sword, ready to whack him again once he regained his feet. The men began to laugh. \\n\"Enough!\" Ser Rodrik called out. He gave the prince a hand and \\nyanked him back to his feet. \"Well fought. Lew, Donnis, help them out of their armor.\" He looked \\naround. \"Prince Joffrey, Robb, will you go another round?\" \\n  47\\n\\nRobb, already sweaty from a previous bout, moved forward eagerly. \"Gladly.\" \\nJoffrey moved into the sunlight in response to Rodrik\\'s summons. His hair shone like spun gold. He \\nlooked bored. \"This is a game for children, Ser Rodrik.\" \\nTheon Greyjoy gave a sudden bark of laughter. \"You are children,\" he said derisively. \\n\"Robb may be a child,\" Joffrey said. \"I am a prince. And I grow tired of swatting at Starks with a play \\nsword.\" \\n\"You got more swats than you gave, Joff,\" Robb said. \"Are you afraid?\" \\nPrince Joffrey looked at him. \"Oh, terrified,\" he said. \"You\\'re so much older.\" Some of the Lannister men \\nlaughed. \\nJon looked down on the scene with a frown. \"Joffrey is truly a little shit,\" he told Arya. \\nSer Rodrik tugged thoughtfully at his white whiskers. \"What are you suggesting?\" he asked the prince. \\n\"Live steel.\" \\n\"Done,\" Robb shot back. \"You\\'ll be sorry!\" \\nThe master-at-arms put a hand on Robb\\'s shoulder to quiet him. \"Live steel is too dangerous. I will \\npermit you tourney swords, with blunted edges.\" \\nJoffrey said nothing, but a man strange to Arya, a tall knight with black hair and burn scars on his face, \\npushed forward in front of the prince. \"This is your prince. Who are you to tell him he may not have an \\nedge on his sword, ser?\" \\n\"Master-at-arms of Winterfell, Clegane, and you would do well not to forget it.\" \\n\"Are you training women here?\" the burned man wanted to know. He was muscled like a bull. \\n\"I am training knights,\" Ser Rodrik said pointedly. \"They will have steel when they are ready. When they \\nare of an age.\" \\nThe burned man looked at Robb. \"How old are you, boy?\" \\n\"Fourteen,\" Robb said. \\n\"I killed a man at twelve. You can be sure it was not with a blunt sword.\" \\nArya could see Robb bristle. His pride was wounded. He turned on Ser Rodrik. \"Let me do it. I can \\nbeat him.\" \\n\"Beat him with a tourney blade, then,\" Ser Rodrik said. \\nJoffrey shrugged. \"Come and see me when you\\'re older, Stark. If you\\'re not too old.\" There was \\nlaughter from the Lannister men. \\n  48\\n\\nRobb\\'s curses rang through the yard. Arya covered her mouth in shock. Theon Greyjoy seized Robb\\'s \\narm to keep him away from the prince. Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers in dismay. \\nJoffrey feigned a yawn and turned to his younger brother. \"Come, Tommen,\" he said. \"The hour of play \\nis done. Leave the children to their frolics.\" \\nThat brought more laughter from the Lannisters, more curses from Robb. Ser Rodrik\\'s face was \\nbeet-red with fury under the white of his whiskers. Theon kept Robb locked in an iron grip until the \\nprinces and their party were safely away. \\nJon watched them leave, and Arya watched Jon. His face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of \\nthe godswood. Finally he climbed down off the window. \"The show is done,\" he said. He bent to scratch \\nGhost behind the ears. The white wolf rose and rubbed against him. \"You had best run back to your \\nroom, little sister. Septa Mordane will surely be lurking. The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. \\nYou\\'ll be sewing all through winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle \\nstill locked tight between your frozen fingers.\" \\nArya didn\\'t think it was funny. \"I hate needlework!\" she said with passion. \"It\\'s not fair!\" \\n\"Nothing is fair,\" Jon said. He messed up her hair again and walked away from her, Ghost moving \\nsilently beside him. Nymeria started to follow too, then stopped and came back when she saw that Arya \\nwas not coming. \\nReluctantly she turned in the other direction. \\nIt was worse than Jon had thought. It wasn\\'t Septa Mordane waiting in her room. It was Septa Mordane \\nand her mother. \\nBRAN \\nThe hunt left at dawn. The king wanted wild boar at the feast tonight. Prince Joffrey rode with his father, \\nso Robb had been allowed to join the hunters as well. Uncle Benjen, Jory, Theon Greyjoy, Ser Rodrik, \\nand even the queen\\'s funny little brother had all ridden out with them. It was the last hunt, after all. On the \\nmorrow they left for the south. \\nBran had been left behind with Jon and the girls and Rickon. But Rickon was only a baby and the girls \\nwere only girls and Jon and his wolf were nowhere to be found. Bran did not look for him very hard. He \\nthought Jon was angry at him. Jon seemed to be angry at everyone these days. Bran did not know why. \\nHe was going with Uncle Ben to the Wall, to join the Night\\'s Watch. That was almost as good as going \\nsouth with the king. Robb was the one they were leaving behind, not Jon. \\nFor days, Bran could scarcely wait to be off. He was going to ride the kingsroad on a horse of his own, \\nnot a pony but a real horse. His father would be the Hand of the King, and they were going to live in the \\nred castle at King\\'s Landing, the castle the Dragonlords had built. Old Nan said there were ghosts there, \\nand dungeons where terrible things had been done, and dragon heads on the walls. It gave Bran a shiver \\njust to think of it, but he was not afraid. How could he be afraid? \\nHis father would be with him, and the king with all his knights and sworn swords. \\n  49\\n\\nBran was going to be a knight himself someday, one of the Kingsguard. Old Nan said they were the \\nfinest swords in all the realm. There were only seven of them, and they wore white armor and had no \\nwives or children, but lived only to serve the king. Bran knew all the stories. Their names were like music \\nto him. Serwyn of the Mirror Shield. Ser Ryam Redwyne. Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. The twins \\nSer Erryk and Ser Arryk, who had died on one another\\'s swords hundreds of years ago, when brother \\nfought sister in the war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons. The White Bull, Gerold Hightower. \\nSer Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Barristan the Bold. \\nTwo of the Kingsguard had come north with King Robert. Bran had watched them with fascination, \\nnever quite daring to speak to them. Ser Boros was a bald man with a jowly face, and Ser Meryn had \\ndroopy eyes and a beard the color of rust. Ser Jaime Lannister looked more like the knights in the \\nstories, and he was of the Kingsguard too, but Robb said he had killed the old mad king and shouldn\\'t \\ncount anymore. The greatest living knight was Ser Barristan Selmy, Barristan the Bold, the Lord \\nCommander of the Kingsguard. Father had promised that they would meet Ser Barristan when they \\nreached King\\'s Landing, and Bran had been marking the days on his wall, eager to depart, to see a world \\nhe had only dreamed of and begin a life he could scarcely imagine. \\nYet now that the last day was at hand, suddenly Bran felt lost. Winterfell had been the only home he had \\never known. His father had told him that he ought to say his farewells today, and he had tried. After the \\nhunt had ridden out, he wandered through the castle with his wolf at his side, intending to visit the ones \\nwho would be left behind, Old Nan and Gage the cook, Mikken in his smithy, Hodor the stableboy who \\nsmiled so much and took care of his pony and never said anything but \"Hodor,\" the man in the glass \\ngardens who gave him a blackberry when he came to visit . . . \\nBut it was no good. He had gone to the stable first, and seen his pony there in its stall, except it wasn\\'t \\nhis pony anymore, he was getting a real horse and leaving the pony behind, and all of a sudden Bran just \\nwanted to sit down and cry. He turned and ran off before Hodor and the other stableboys could see the \\ntears in his eyes. That was the end of his farewells. Instead Bran spent the morning alone in the \\ngodswood, trying to teach his wolf to fetch a stick, and failing. The wolfling was smarter than any of the \\nhounds in his father\\'s kennel and Bran would \\nhave sworn he understood every word that was said to him, but he showed very little interest in chasing \\nsticks. \\nHe was still trying to decide on a name. Robb was calling his Grey Wind, because he ran so fast. Sansa \\nhad named hers Lady, and Arya named hers after some old witch queen in the songs, and little Rickon \\ncalled his Shaggydog, which Bran thought was a pretty stupid name for a direwolf. Jon\\'s wolf, the white \\none, was Ghost. Bran wished he had thought of that first, even though his wolf wasn\\'t white. He had tried \\na hundred names in the last fortnight, but none of them sounded right. \\nFinally he got tired of the stick game and decided to go climbing. He hadn\\'t been up to the broken tower \\nfor weeks with everything that had happened, and this might be his last chance. \\nHe raced across the godswood, taking the long way around to avoid the pool where the heart tree grew. \\nThe heart tree had always frightened him; trees ought not have eyes, Bran thought, or leaves that looked \\nlike hands. His wolf came sprinting at his heels. \"You stay here,\" he told him at the base of the sentinel \\ntree near the armory wall. \"Lie down. That\\'s right. Now stay-\" \\nThe wolf did as he was told. Bran scratched him behind the ears, then turned away, jumped, grabbed a \\nlow branch, and pulled himself up. He was halfway up the tree, moving easily from limb to limb, when the \\nwolf got to his feet and began to howl. \\n  50\\n\\nBran looked back down. His wolf fell silent, staring up at him through slitted yellow eyes. A strange chill \\nwent through him. He began to climb again. Once more the wolf howled. \"Quiet,\" he yelled. \"Sit down. \\nStay. You\\'re worse than Mother.\" The howling chased him all the way up the tree, until finally he jumped \\noff onto the armory roof and out of sight. \\nThe rooftops of Winterfell were Bran\\'s second home. His mother often said that Bran could climb before \\nhe could walk. Bran could not remember when he first learned to walk, but he could not remember when \\nhe started to climb either, so he supposed it must be true. \\nTo a boy, Winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and tunnels \\nspreading out in all directions. In the older parts of the castle, the halls slanted up and down so that you \\ncouldn\\'t even be sure what floor you were on. The place had grown over the centuries like some \\nmonstrous stone tree, Maester Luwin told him once, and its branches were gnarled and thick and \\ntwisted, its roots sunk deep into the earth. \\nWhen he got out from under it and scrambled up near the sky, Bran could see all of Winterfell in a \\nglance. He liked the way it looked, spread out beneath him, only birds wheeling over his head while all \\nthe \\nlife of the castle went on below. Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles \\nthat brooded over the First Keep, watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the \\ncooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden, restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels, the \\nsilence of the godswood, the girls gossiping beside the washing well. It made him feel like he was lord of \\nthe castle, in a way even Robb would never know. \\nIt taught him Winterfell\\'s secrets too. The builders had not even leveled the earth; there were hills and \\nvalleys behind the walls of Winterfell. There was a covered bridge that went from the fourth floor of the \\nbell tower across to the second floor of the rookery. Bran knew about that. And he knew you could get \\ninside the inner wall by the south gate, climb three floors and run all the way around Winterfell through a \\nnarrow tunnel in the stone, and then come out on ground level at the north gate, with a hundred feet of \\nwall looming over you. Even Maester Luwin didn\\'t know that, Bran was convinced. \\nHis mother was terrified that one day Bran would slip off a wall and kill himself. He told her that he \\nwouldn\\'t, but she never believed him. Once she made him promise that he would stay on the ground. He \\nhad managed to keep that promise for almost a fortnight, miserable every day, until one night he had gone \\nout the window of his bedroom when his brothers were fast asleep. \\nHe confessed his crime the next day in a fit of guilt. Lord Eddard ordered him to the godswood to \\ncleanse himself. Guards were posted to see that Bran remained there alone all night to reflect on his \\ndisobedience. The next morning Bran was nowhere to be seen. They finally found him fast asleep in the \\nupper branches of the tallest sentinel in the grove. \\nAs angry as he was, his father could not help but laugh. \"You\\'re not my son,\" he told Bran when they \\nfetched him down, \"you\\'re a squirrel. So be it. If you must climb, then climb, but try not to let your \\nmother see you.\" \\nBran did his best, although he did not think he ever really footed her. Since his father would not forbid it, \\nshe turned to others. Old Nan told him a story about a bad little boy who climbed too high and was \\nstruck down by lightning, and how afterward the crows came to peck out his eyes. Bran was not \\nimpressed. There were crows\\' nests atop the broken tower, where no one ever went but him, and \\n  51\\n\\nsometimes he filled his pockets with corn before he climbed up there and the crows ate it right out of his \\nhand. None of them had ever shown the slightest bit of interest in pecking out his eyes. \\nLater, Maester Luwin built a little pottery boy and dressed him in \\nBran\\'s clothes and flung him off the wall into the yard below, to demonstrate what would happen to Bran \\nif he fell. That had been fun, but afterward Bran just looked at the maester and said, \"I\\'m not made of \\nclay. And anyhow, I never fall.\" \\nThen for a while the guards would chase him whenever they saw him on the roofs, and try to haul him \\ndown. That was the best time of all. It was like playing a game with his brothers, except that Bran always \\nwon. None of the guards could climb half so well as Bran, not even Jory. Most of the time they never \\nsaw him anyway. People never looked up. That was another thing he liked about climbing; it was almost \\nlike being invisible. \\nHe liked how it felt too, pulling himself up a wall stone by stone, fingers and toes digging hard into the \\nsmall crevices between. He always took off his boots and went barefoot when he climbed; it made him \\nfeel as if he had four hands instead of two. He liked the deep, sweet ache it left in the muscles afterward. \\nHe liked the way the air tasted way up high, sweet and cold as a winter peach. He liked the birds: the \\ncrows in the broken tower, the tiny little sparrows that nested in cracks between the stones, the ancient \\nowl that slept in the dusty loft above the old armory. Bran knew them all. \\nMost of all, he liked going places that no one else could go, and seeing the grey sprawl of Winterfell in a \\nway that no one else ever saw it. It made the whole castle Bran\\'s secret place. \\nHis favorite haunt was the broken tower. Once it had been a watchtower, the tallest in Winterfell. A long \\ntime ago, a hundred years before even his father had been born, a lightning strike had set it afire. The top \\nthird of the structure had collapsed inward, and the tower had never been rebuilt. Sometimes his father \\nsent ratters into the base of the tower, to clean out the nests they always found among the jumble of fallen \\nstones and charred and rotten beams. But no one ever got up to the jagged top of the structure now \\nexcept for Bran and the crows. \\nHe knew two ways to get there. You could climb straight up the side of the tower itself, but the stones \\nwere loose, the mortar that held them together long gone to ash, and Bran never liked to put his full \\nweight on them. \\nThe best way was to start from the godswood, shinny up the tall sentinel, and cross over the armory and \\nthe guards hall, leaping roof to roof, barefoot so the guards wouldn\\'t hear you overhead. That brought \\nyou up to the blind side of the First Keep, the oldest part of the castle, a squat round fortress that was \\ntaller than it looked. Only rats and spiders lived there now but the old stones still made for good climbing. \\nYou could go straight up to where the gargoyles leaned out blindly \\nover empty space, and swing from gargoyle to gargoyle, hand over hand, around to the north side. From \\nthere, if you really stretched, you could reach out and pull yourself over to the broken tower where it \\nleaned close. The last part was the scramble up the blackened stones to the eyrie, no more than ten feet, \\nand then the crows would come round to see if you\\'d brought any corn. \\nBran was moving from gargoyle to gargoyle with the ease of long practice when he heard the voices. He \\nwas so startled he almost lost his grip. The First Keep had been empty all his life. \\n\"I do not like it,\" a woman was saying. There was a row of windows beneath him, and the voice was \\n  52\\n\\ndrifting out of the last window on this side. \"You should be the Hand.\" \\n\"Gods forbid,\" a man\\'s voice replied lazily. \"It\\'s not an honor I\\'d want. There\\'s far too much work \\ninvolved.\" \\nBran hung, listening, suddenly afraid to go on. They might glimpse his feet if he tried to swing by. \\n\"Don\\'t you see the danger this puts us in?\" the woman said. \"Robert loves the man like a brother.\" \\n\"Robert can barely stomach his brothers. Not that I blame him. Stannis would be enough to give anyone \\nindigestion.\" \\n\"Don\\'t play the fool. Stannis and Renly are one thing, and Eddard Stark is quite another. Robert will \\nlisten to Stark. Damn them both. I should have insisted that he name you, but I was certain Stark would \\nrefuse him.\" \\n\"We ought to count ourselves fortunate,\" the man said. \"The king might as easily have named one of his \\nbrothers, or even Littlefinger, gods help us. Give me honorable enemies rather than ambitious ones, and \\nI\\'ll sleep more easily by night.\" \\nThey were talking about Father, Bran realized. He wanted to hear more. A few more feet . . . but they \\nwould see him if he swung out in front of the window. \\n\"We will have to watch him carefully,\" the woman said. \\n\"I would sooner watch you,\" the man said. He sounded bored. \"Come back here.\" \\n\"Lord Eddard has never taken any interest in anything that happened south of the Neck,\" the woman \\nsaid. \"Never. I tell you, he means to move against us. Why else would he leave the seat of his power?\" \\n\"A hundred reasons. Duty. Honor. He yearns to write his name large across the book of history, to get \\naway from his wife, or both. Perhaps he just wants to be warm for once in his life.\" \\n\"His wife is Lady Arryn\\'s sister. It\\'s a wonder Lysa was not here to greet us with her accusations.\" \\nBran looked down. There was a narrow ledge beneath the window, only a few inches wide. He tried to \\nlower himself toward it. Too far. He would never reach. \\n\"You fret too much. Lysa Arryn is a frightened cow.\" \\n\"That frightened cow shared Jon Arryn\\'s bed.\" \\n\"If she knew anything, she would have gone to Robert before she fled King\\'s Landing.\" \\n\"When he had already agreed to foster that weakling son of hers at Casterly Rock? I think not. She \\nknew the boy\\'s life would be hostage to her silence. She may grow bolder now that he\\'s safe atop the \\nEyrie.\" \\n\"Mothers.\" The man made the word sound like a curse. \"I think birthing does something to your minds. \\nYou are all mad.\" He laughed. It was a bitter sound. \"Let Lady Arryn grow as bold as she likes. \\nWhatever she knows, whatever she thinks she knows, she has no proof.\" He paused a moment. \"Or \\n  53\\n\\ndoes she?\" \\n\"Do you think the king will require proof?\" the woman said. \"I tell you, he loves me not.\" \\n\"And whose fault is that, sweet sister?\" \\nBran studied the ledge. He could drop down. It was too narrow to land on, but if he could catch hold as \\nhe fell past, pull himself up . . . except that might make a noise, draw them to the window. He was not \\nsure what he was hearing, but he knew it was not meant for his ears. \\n\"You are as blind as Robert,\" the woman was saying. \\n\"If you mean I see the same thing, yes,\" the man said. \"I see a man who would sooner die than betray his \\nking.\" \\n\"He betrayed one already, or have you forgotten?\" the woman said. \"Oh, I don\\'t deny he\\'s loyal to \\nRobert, that\\'s obvious. What happens when Robert dies and Joff takes the throne? And the sooner that \\ncomes to pass, the safer we\\'ll all be. My husband grows more restless every day. Having Stark beside \\nhim will only make him worse. He\\'s still in love with the sister, the insipid little dead sixteen-year-old. \\nHow long till he decides to put me aside for some new Lyanna?\" \\nBran was suddenly very frightened. He wanted nothing so much as to go back the way he had come, to \\nfind his brothers. Only what would he tell them? He had to get closer, Bran realized. He had to see who \\nwas talking. \\nThe man sighed. \"You should think less about the future and more about the pleasures at hand.\" \\n\"Stop that!\" the woman said. Bran heard the sudden slap of flesh on flesh, then the man\\'s laughter. \\nBran pulled himself up, climbed over the gargoyle, crawled out onto the roof. This was the easy way. He \\nmoved across the roof to the next gargoyle, right above the window of the room where they were talking. \\n\"All this talk is getting very tiresome, sister,\" the man said. \"Come here and be quiet.\" \\nBran sat astride the gargoyle, tightened his legs around it, and swung himself around, upside down. He \\nhung by his legs and slowly stretched his head down toward the window. The world looked strange \\nupside down. A courtyard swam dizzily below him, its stones still wet with melted snow. \\nBran looked in the window. \\nInside the room, a man and a woman were wrestling. They were both naked. Bran could not tell who \\nthey were. The man\\'s back was to him, and his body screened the woman from view as he pushed her \\nup against a wall. \\nThere were soft, wet sounds. Bran realized they were kissing. He watched, wide-eyed and frightened, \\nhis breath tight in his throat. The man had a hand down between her legs, and he must have been hurting \\nher there, because the woman started to moan, low in her throat. \"Stop it,\" she said, \"stop it, stop it. Oh, \\nplease . . .\" But her voice was low and weak, and she did not push him away. Her hands buried \\nthemselves in his hair, his tangled golden hair, and pulled his face down to her breast. \\nBran saw her face. Her eyes were closed and her mouth was open, moaning. Her golden hair swung \\n  54\\n\\nfrom side to side as her head moved back and forth, but still he recognized the queen. \\nHe must have made a noise. Suddenly her eyes opened, and she was staring right at him. She screamed. \\nEverything happened at once then. \\' The woman pushed the man \\naway wildly, shouting and pointing. Bran tried to pull himself up, \\nbending double as he reached for the gargoyle. He *as in too much of \\na hurry. His hand scraped uselessly across smooth stone, and in his \\npanic his legs slipped, and suddenly he was failing. There was an \\ninstant of vertigo, a sickening lurch as the window flashed past. He \\nshot out a hand, grabbed for the ledge, lost it, caught it again with his \\nother hand. He swung against the building, hard. The impact took the \\nbreath out of him. Bran dangled, one-handed, panting. \\nFaces appeared in the window above him. \\nThe queen. And now Bran recognized the man beside her. They looked as much alike as reflections in a \\nmirror. \\n\"He saw us,\" the woman said shrilly. \\n\"So he did,\" the man said. \\nBran\\'s fingers started to slip. He grabbed the ledge with his other hand. Fingernails dug into unyielding \\nstone. The man reached down. \"Take my hand,\" he said. \"Before you fall.\" \\nBran seized his arm and held on tight with all his strength. The man yanked him up to the ledge. \"What \\nare you doing?\" the woman demanded. \\nThe man ignored her. He was very strong. He stood Bran up on the sill. \"How old are you, boy?\" \\n\"Seven,\" Bran said, shaking with relief. His fingers had dug deep gouges in the man\\'s forearm. He let go \\nsheepishly. \\nThe man looked over at the woman. \"The things I do for love,\" he said with loathing. He gave Bran a \\nshove. \\nScreaming, Bran went backward out the window into empty air. There was nothing to grab on to. The \\ncourtyard rushed up to meet him. \\nSomewhere off in the distance, a wolf was howling. Crows circled the broken tower, waiting for corn. \\n  55\\n\\nTYRION \\nSomewhere in the great stone maze of Winterfell, a wolf howled. The sound hung over the castle like a \\nflag of mourning. \\nTyrion Lannister looked up from his books and shivered, though the library was snug and warm. \\nSomething about the howling of a wolf took a man right out of his here and now and left him in a dark \\nforest of the mind, running naked before the pack. \\nWhen the direwolf howled again, Tyrion shut the heavy leatherbound cover on the book he was reading, \\na hundredyear-old discourse on the changing of the seasons by a long-dead maester. He covered a yawn \\nwith the back of his hand. His reading lamp was flickering, its oil all but gone, as dawn light leaked \\nthrough the high windows. He had been at it all night, but that was nothing new. Tyrion Lannister was not \\nmuch a one for sleeping. \\nHis legs were stiff and sore as he eased down off the bench. He massaged some life back into them and \\nlimped heavily to the table where the septon was snoring softly, his head pillowed on an open book in \\nfront of him. Tyrion glanced at the title. A life of the Grand Maester Aethelmure, no wonder. \"Chayle,\" he \\nsaid softly. The young man jerked up, blinking, confused, the crystal of his order swinging wildly on its \\nsilver chain. \"I\\'m off to break my fast. See that you return the books to the shelves. Be gentle with the \\nValyrian scrolls, the parchment is very dry. Ayrmidon\\'s Engines of War is quite rare, and yours is \\nthe only complete copy I\\'ve ever seen.\" Chayle gaped at him, still halfasleep. Patiently, Tyrion repeated \\nhis instructions, then clapped the septon on the shoulder and left him to his tasks. \\nOutside, Tyrion swallowed a lungful of the cold morning air and began his laborious descent of the steep \\nstone steps that corkscrewed around the exterior of the library tower. It was slow going; the steps were \\ncut high and narrow, while his legs were short and twisted. The rising sun had not yet cleared the walls of \\nWinterfell, but the men were already hard at it in the yard below. Sandor Clegane\\'s rasping voice drifted \\nup to him. \"The boy is a long time dying. I wish he would be quicker about it.\" \\nTyrion glanced down and saw the Hound standing with young Joffrey as squires swarmed around them. \\n\"At least he dies quietly,\" the prince replied. \"It\\'s the wolf that makes the noise. I could scarce sleep last \\nnight.\" \\nClegane cast a long shadow across the hard-packed earth as his squire lowered the black helm over his \\nhead. \"I could silence the creature, if it please you,\" he said through his open visor. His boy placed a \\nlongsword in his hand. He tested the weight of it, slicing at the cold morning air. Behind him, the yard \\nrang to the clangor of steel on steel. \\nThe notion seemed to delight the prince. \"Send a dog to kill a dog!\" he exclaimed. \"Winterfell is so \\ninfested with wolves, the Starks would never miss one.\" \\nTyrion hopped off the last step onto the yard. \"I beg to differ, nephew,\" he said. \"The Starks can count \\npast six. Unlike some princes I might name.\" \\nJoffrey had the grace at least to blush. \\n  56\\n\\n\"A voice from nowhere,\" Sandor said. He peered through his helm, looking this way and that. \"Spirits of \\nthe air!\" \\nThe prince laughed, as he always laughed when his bodyguard did this mummer\\'s farce. Tyrion was used \\nto it. \"Down here.\" \\nThe tall man peered down at the ground, and pretended to notice him. \"The little lord Tyrion,\" he said. \\n\"My pardons. I did not see you standing there.\" \\n\"I am in no mood for your insolence today.\" Tyrion turned to his nephew. \"Joffrey, it is past time you \\ncalled on Lord Eddard and his lady, to offer them your comfort.\" \\nJoffrey looked as petulant as only a boy prince can look. \"What good will my comfort do them?\" \\n\"None,\" Tyrion said. \"Yet it is expected of you. Your absence has been noted.\" \\n\"The Stark boy is nothing to me,\" Joffrey said. \"I cannot abide the wailing of women.\" \\nTyrion Lannister reached up and slapped his nephew hard across the face. The boy\\'s cheek began to \\nredden. \\n\"One word,\" Tyrion said, \"and I will hit you again.\" \\n\"I\\'m going to tell Mother!\" Joffrey exclaimed. \\nTyrion hit him again. Now both cheeks flamed. \\n\"You tell your mother,\" Tyrion told him. \"But first you get yourself to Lord and Lady Stark, and you fall \\nto your knees in front of them, and you tell them how very sorry you are, and that you are at their service \\nif there is the slightest thing you can do for them or theirs in this desperate hour, and that all your prayers \\ngo with them. Do you understand? Do you?\" \\nThe boy looked as though he was going to cry. Instead, he managed a weak nod. Then he turned and \\nfled headlong from the yard, holding his cheek. Tyrion watched him run. \\nA shadow fell across his face. He turned to find Clegane looming overhead like a cliff. His soot-dark \\narmor seemed to blot out the sun. He had lowered the visor on his helm. It was fashioned in the likeness \\nof a snarling black hound, fearsome to behold, but Tyrion had always thought it a great improvement \\nover Clegane\\'s hideously burned face. \\n\"The prince will remember that, little lord,\" the Hound warned him. The helm turned his laugh into a \\nhollow rumble. \\n\"I pray he does,\" Tyrion Lannister replied. \"If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him.\" He glanced \\naround the courtyard. \"Do you know where I might find my brother?\" \\n\"Breaking fast with the queen.\" \\n\"Ah,\" Tyrion said. He gave Sandor Clegane a perfunctory nod and walked away as briskly as his \\nstunted legs would carry him, whistling. He pitied the first knight to try the Hound today. The man did \\nhave a temper. \\n  57\\n\\nA cold, cheerless meal had been laid out in the morning room of the Guest House. Jaime sat at table with \\nCersei and the children, talking in low, hushed voices. \\n\"Is Robert still abed?\" Tyrion asked as he seated himself, uninvited, at the table. \\nHis sister peered at him with the same expression of faint distaste she had worn since the day he was \\nborn. \"The king has not slept at all,\" she told him. \"He is with Lord Eddard. He has taken their sorrow \\ndeeply to heart.\" \\n\"He has a large heart, our Robert,\" Jaime said with a lazy smile. There was very little that Jaime took \\nseriously. Tyrion knew that about \\nhis brother, and forgave it. During all the terrible long years of his childhood, only Jaime had ever shown \\nhim the smallest measure of affection or respect, and for that Tyrion was willing to forgive him most \\nanything. \\nA servant approached. \"Bread,\" Tyrion told him, \"and two of those little fish, and a mug of that good \\ndark beer to wash them down. Oh, and some bacon. Burn it until it turns black.\" The man bowed and \\nmoved off. Tyrion turned back to his siblings. Twins, male and female. They looked very much the part \\nthis morning. Both had chosen a deep green that matched their eyes. Their blond curls were all a \\nfashionable tumble, and gold ornaments shone at wrists and fingers and throats. \\nTyrion wondered what it would be like to have a twin, and decided that he would rather not know. Bad \\nenough to face himself in a looking glass every day. Another him was a thought too dreadful to \\ncontemplate. \\nPrince Tommen spoke up. \"Do you have news of Bran, Uncle?\" \\n\"I stopped by the sickroom last night,\" Tyrion announced. \"There was no change. The maester thought \\nthat a hopeful sign.\" \\n\"I don\\'t want Brandon to die,\" Tommen said timorously. He was a sweet boy. Not like his brother, but \\nthen Jaime and Tyrion were somewhat less than peas in a pod themselves. \\n\"Lord Eddard had a brother named Brandon as well,\" Jaime mused. \"One of the hostages murdered by \\nTargaryen. It seems to be an unlucky name.\" \\n\"Oh, not so unlucky as all that, surely,\" Tyrion said. The servant brought his plate. He ripped off a chunk \\nof black bread. \\nCersei was studying him warily. \"What do you mean?\" \\nTyrion gave her a crooked smile. \"Why, only that Tommen may get his wish. The maester thinks the boy \\nmay yet live.\" He took a sip of beer. \\nMyrcella gave a happy gasp, and Tommen smiled nervously, but it was not the children Tyrion was \\nwatching. The glance that passed between Jaime and Cersei lasted no more than a second, but he did not \\nmiss it. Then his sister dropped her gaze to the table. \"That is no mercy. These northern gods are cruel to \\nlet the child linger in such pain.\" \\n  58\\n\\n\"What were the maester\\'s words?\" Jaime asked. \\nThe bacon crunched when he bit into it. Tyrion chewed thoughtfully for a moment and said, \"He thinks \\nthat if the boy were going to die, he would have done so already. It has been four days with no change.\" \\n\"Will Bran get better, Uncle?\" little Myrcella asked. She had all of her mother\\'s beauty, and none of her \\nnature. \\n\"His back is broken, little one,\" Tyrion told her. \"The fall shattered his legs as well. They keep him alive \\nwith honey and water, or he would starve to death. Perhaps, if he wakes, he will be able to eat real food, \\nbut he will never walk again.\" \\n\"If he wakes,\" Cersei repeated. \"Is that likely?\" \\n\"The gods alone know,\" Tyrion told her. \"The maester only hopes.\" He chewed some more bread. \"I \\nwould swear that wolf of his is keeping the boy alive. The creature is outside his window day and night, \\nhowling. Every time they chase it away, it returns. The maester said they closed the window once, to shut \\nout the noise, and Bran seemed to weaken. When they opened it again, his heart beat stronger.\" \\nThe queen shuddered. \"There is something unnatural about those animals,\" she said. \"They are \\ndangerous. I will not have any of them coming south with us.\" \\nJaime said, \"You\\'ll have a hard time stopping them, sister. They follow those girls everywhere.\" \\nTyrion started on his fish. \"Are you leaving soon, then?\" \\n\"Not near soon enough,\" Cersei said. Then she frowned. \"Are we leaving?\" she echoed. \"What about \\nyou? Gods, don\\'t tell me you are staying here?\" \\nTyrion shrugged. \"Benjen Stark is returning to the Night\\'s Watch with his brother\\'s bastard. I have a \\nmind to go with them and see this Wall we have all heard so much of.\" \\nJaime smiled. \"I hope you\\'re not thinking of taking the black on us, sweet brother.\" \\nTyrion laughed. \"What, me, celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. No, \\nI just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.\" \\nCersei stood abruptly. \"The children don\\'t need to hear this filth. Tommen, Myrcella, come.\" She strode \\nbriskly from the morning room, her train and her pups trailing behind her. \\nJaime Lannister regarded his brother thoughtfully with those cool green eyes. \"Stark will never consent to \\nleave Winterfell with his son lingering in the shadow of death.\" \\n\"He will if Robert commands it,\" Tyrion said. \"And Robert will command it. There is nothing Lord \\nEddard can do for the boy in any case.\" \\n\"He could end his torment,\" Jaime said. \"I would, if it were my son. It would be a mercy.\" \\n\"I advise against putting that suggestion to Lord Eddard, sweet brother,\" Tyrion said. \"He would not \\ntake it kindly.\" \\n  59\\n\\n\"Even if the boy does live, he will be a cripple. Worse than a cripple. A grotesque. Give me a good \\nclean death.\" \\nTyrion replied with a shrug that accentuated the twist of his shoulders. \"Speaking for the grotesques,\" he \\nsaid, \"I beg to differ. Death is so terribly final, while life is full of possibilities.\" \\nJaime smiled. \"You are a perverse little imp, aren\\'t you?\" \\n\"Oh, yes,\" Tyrion admitted. \"I hope the boy does wake. I would be most interested to hear what he \\nmight have to say.\" \\nHis brother\\'s smile curdled like sour milk. \"Tyrion, my sweet brother,\" he said darkly, \"there are times \\nwhen you give me cause to wonder whose side you are on.\" \\nTyrion\\'s mouth was full of bread and fish. He took a swallow of strong black beer to wash it all down, \\nand grinned up wolfishly at Jaime, \"Why, Jaime, my sweet brother,\" he said, \"you wound me. You know \\nhow much I love my family.\" \\nJON \\non climbed the steps slowly, trying not to think that this might be the last time ever. Ghost padded silently \\nbeside him. Outside, snow swirled through the castle gates, and the yard was all noise and chaos, but \\ninside the thick stone walls it was still warm and quiet. Too quiet for Jon\\'s liking. \\nHe reached the landing and stood for a long moment, afraid. Ghost nuzzled at his hand. He took courage \\nfrom that. He straightened, and entered the room. \\nLady Stark was there beside his bed. She had been there, day and night, for close on a fortnight. Not \\nfor a moment had she left Bran\\'s side. She had her meals brought to her there, and chamber pots as well, \\nand a small hard bed to sleep on, though it was said she had scarcely slept at all. She fed him herself, the \\nhoney and water and herb mixture that sustained life. Not once did she leave the room. So Jon had \\nstayed away. \\nBut now there was no more time. \\nHe stood in the door for a moment, afraid to speak, afraid to come closer. The window was open. \\nBelow, a wolf howled. Ghost heard and lifted his head. \\nLady Stark looked over. For a moment she did not seem to recognize him. Finally she blinked. \"What \\nareyou doing here?\" she asked in a voice strangely flat and emotionless. \\n\"I came to see Bran,\" Jon said. \"To say good-bye.\" \\nHer face did not change. Her long auburn hair was dull and tangled. She looked as though she had aged \\ntwenty years. \"You\\'ve said it. Now go away.\" \\nPart of him wanted only to flee, but he knew that if he did he might never see Bran again. He took a \\nnervous step into the room. \"Please,\" he said. \\n  60\\n\\nSomething cold moved in her eyes. \"I told you to leave,\" she said. \"We don\\'t want you here.\" \\nOnce that would have sent him running. Once that might even have made him cry. Now it only made him \\nangry. He would be a Sworn Brother of the Night\\'s Watch soon, and face worse dangers than Catelyn \\nTully Stark. \"He\\'s my brother,\" he said. \\n\"Shall I call the guards?\" \\n\"Call them,\" Jon said, defiant. \"You can\\'t stop me from seeing him.\" He crossed the room, keeping the \\nbed between them, and looked down on Bran where he lay. \\nShe was holding one of his hands. It looked like a claw. This was not the Bran he remembered. The \\nflesh had all gone from him. His skin stretched tight over bones like sticks. Under the blanket, his legs \\nbent in ways that made Jon sick. His eyes were sunken deep into black pits; open, but they saw nothing. \\nThe fall had shrunken him somehow. He looked half a leaf, as if the first strong wind would carry him off \\nto his grave. \\nYet under the frail cage of those shattered ribs, his chest rose and fell with each shallow breath. \\n\"Bran,\" he said, \"I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t come before. I was afraid.\" He could feel the tears rolling down his \\ncheeks. Jon no longer cared. \"Don\\'t die, Bran. Please. We\\'re all waiting for you to wake up. Me and \\nRobb and the girls, everyone . . .\" \\nLady Stark was watching. She had not raised a cry. Jon took that for acceptance. Outside the window, \\nthe direwolf howled again. The wolf that Bran had not had time to name. \\n\"I have to go now,\" Jon said. \"Uncle Benjen is waiting. I\\'m to go north to the Wall. We have to leave \\ntoday, before the snows come.\" He remembered how excited Bran had been at the prospect of the \\njourney. It was more than he could bear, the thought of leaving him behind like this. Jon brushed away his \\ntears, leaned over, and kissed his brother lightly on the lips. \\n\"I wanted him to stay here with me,\" Lady Stark said softly. \\nJon watched her, wary. She was not even looking at him. She was \\n84 GEORGE R.R. MARTM \\ntalking to him, but for a part of her, it was as though he were not even in the room. \\n\"I prayed for it,\" she said dully. \"He was my special boy. I went to the sept and prayed seven times to \\nthe seven faces of god that Ned would change his mind and leave him here with me. Sometimes prayers \\nare answered.\" \\nJon did not know what to say. \"It wasn\\'t your fault,\" he managed after an awkward silence. \\nHer eyes found him. They were full of poison. \"I need none of your absolution, bastard.\" \\nJon lowered his eyes. She was cradling one of Bran\\'s hands. He took the other, squeezed it. Fingers like \\nthe bones of birds. \"Good-bye,\" he said. \\nHe was at the door when she called out to him. \"Jon,\" she said. He should have kept going, but she had \\n  61\\n\\nnever called him by his name before. He turned to find her looking at his face, as if she were seeing it for \\nthe first time. \\n\"Yes?\" he said. \\n\"It should have been you,\" she told him. Then she turned back to Bran and began to weep, her whole \\nbody shaking with the sobs. Jon had never seen her cry before. \\nIt was a long walk down to the yard. \\nOutside, everything was noise and confusion. Wagons were being loaded, men were shouting, horses \\nwere being harnessed and saddled and led from the stables. A light snow had begun to fall, and everyone \\nwas in an uproar to be off. \\nRobb was in the middle of it, shouting commands with the best of them. He seemed to have grown of \\nlate, as if Bran\\'s fall and his mother\\'s collapse had somehow made him stronger. Grey Wind was at his \\nside. \\n\"Uncle Benjen is looking for you,\" he told Jon. \"He wanted to be gone an hour ago.\" \\n\"I know,\" Jon said. \"Soon.\" He looked around at all the noise and confusion. \"Leaving is harder than I \\nthought.\" \\n\"For me too,\" Robb said. He had snow in his hair, melting from the heat of his body. \"Did you see him?\" \\nJon nodded, not trusting himself to speak. \\n\"He\\'s not going to die,\" Robb said. \"I know it.\" \\n\"You Starks are hard to kill,\" Jon agreed. His voice was flat and tired. The visit had taken all the strength \\nfrom him. \\nRobb knew something was wrong. \"My mother \\n\"She was . . . very kind,\" Jon told him. \\nRobb looked relieved. \"Good.\" He smiled. \"The next time I see you, you\\'ll be all in black.\" \\nJon forced himself to smile back. \"It was always my color. How long do you think it will be?\" \\n\"Soon enough,\" Robb promised. He pulled Jon to him and embraced him fiercely. \"Farewell, Snow.\" \\nJon hugged him back. \"And you, Stark. Take care of Bran.\" \\n\"I will.\" They broke apart and looked at each other awkwardly. \"Uncle Benjen said to send you to the \\nstables if I saw you,\" Robb finally said. \\n\"I have one more farewell to make,\" Jon told him. \\n\"Then I haven\\'t seen you,\" Robb replied. Jon left him standing there in the snow, surrounded by wagons \\nand wolves and horses. It was a short walk to the armory. He picked up his package and took the \\n  62\\n\\ncovered bridge across to the Keep. \\nArya was in her room, packing a polished ironwood chest that was bigger than she was. Nymeria was \\nhelping. Arya would only have to point, and the wolf would bound across the room, snatch up some wisp \\nof silk in her jaws, and fetch it back. But when she smelled Ghost, she sat down on her haunches and \\nyelped at them. \\nArya glanced behind her, saw Jon, and jumped to her feet. She threw her skinny arms tight around his \\nneck. \"I was afraid you were gone,\" she said, her breath catching in her throat. \"They wouldn\\'t let me out \\nto say good-bye.\" \\n\"What did you do now?\" Jon was amused. \\nArya disentangled herself from him and made a face. \"Nothing. I was all packed and everything.\" She \\ngestured at the huge chest, no more than a third full, and at the clothes that were scattered all over the \\nroom. \"Septa Mordane says I have to do it all over. My things weren\\'t properly folded, she says. A \\nproper southron lady doesn\\'t just throw her clothes inside her chest like old rags, she says.\" \\n\"Is that what you did, little sister?\" \\n\"Well, they\\'re going to get all messed up anyway,\" she said. \"Who cares how they\\'re folded?\" \\n\"Septa Mordane,\" Jon told her. \"I don\\'t think she\\'d like Nymeria helping, either.\" The she-wolf regarded \\nhim silently with her dark golden eyes. \"It\\'s just as well. I have something for you to take with you, and it \\nhas to be packed very carefully.\" \\nHer face lit up. \"A present?\" \\n\"You could call it that. Close the door.\" \\nWary but excited, Arya checked the hall. \"Nymeria, here. Guard.\" She left the wolf out there to warn of \\nintruders and closed the door. By \\nthen Jon had pulled off the rags he\\'d wrapped it in. He held it out to her. \\nArya\\'s eyes went wide. Dark eyes, like his. \"A sword,\" she said in a small, hushed breath. \\nThe scabbard was soft grey leather, supple as sin. Jon drew out the blade slowly, so she could see the \\ndeep blue sheen of the steel. \"This is no toy,\" he told her. \"Be careful you don\\'t cut yourself. The edges \\nare sharp enough to shave with.\" \\n\"Girls don\\'t shave,\" Arya said. \\n\"Maybe they should. Have you ever seen the septa\\'s legs?\" \\nShe giggled at him. \"It\\'s so skinny.\" \\n\"So are you,\" Jon told her. \"I had Mikken make this special. The bravos use swords like this in Pentos \\nand Myr and the other Free Cities. It won\\'t hack a man\\'s head off, but it can poke him full of holes if \\nyou\\'re fast enough.\" \\n  63\\n\\n\"I can be fast,\" Arya said. \\n\"You\\'ll have to work at it every day.\" He put the sword in her hands, showed her how to hold it, and \\nstepped back. \"How does it feel? Do you like the balance?\" \\n\"I think so,\" Arya said. \\n\"First lesson,\" Jon said. \"Stick them with the pointy end.\" \\nArya gave him a whap on the arm with the flat of her blade. The blow stung, but Jon found himself \\ngrinning like an idiot. \"I know which end to use,\" Arya said. A doubtful look crossed her face. \"Septa \\nMordane will take it away from me.\" \\n\"Not if she doesn\\'t know you have it,\" Jon said. \\n\"Who will I practice with?\" \\n\"You\\'ll find someone,\" Jon promised her. \"King\\'s Landing is a true city, a thousand times the size of \\nWinterfell. Until you find a partner, watch how they fight in the yard. Run, and ride, make yourself strong. \\nAnd whatever you do . . .\" \\nArya knew what was coming next. They said it together. \\n11 * . . don\\'t . . . tell . . . Sansa!\" \\nJon messed up her hair. \"I will miss you, little sister.\" \\nSuddenly she looked like she was going to cry. \"I wish you were coming with us.\" \\n\"Different roads sometimes lead to the same castle. Who knows?\" He was feeling better now. He was \\nnot going to let himself be sad. \"I better go. I\\'ll spend my first year on the Wall emptying chamber pots if I \\nkeep Uncle Ben waiting any longer.\" \\nArya ran to him for a last hug. \"Put down the sword first,\" Jon \\nwarned her, laughing. She set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses. \\nWhen he turned back at the door, she was holding it again, trying it for balance. \"I almost forgot,\" he told \\nher. \"All the best swords have names.\" \\n\"Like Ice,\" she said. She looked at the blade in her hand. \"Does this have a name? Oh, tell me.\" \\n\"Can\\'t you guess?\" Jon teased. \"Your very favorite thing.\" \\nArya seemed puzzled at first. Then it came to her. She was that quick. They said it together: \\n\"Needle!\" \\nThe memory of her laughter warmed him on the long ride north. \\n  64\\n\\nDAENERYS \\nDaenerys Targaryen wed Khal Drogo with fear and barbaric splendor in a field beyond the walls of \\nPentos, for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a man\\'s life must be done beneath the \\nopen sky. \\nDrogo had called his khalasar to attend him and they had come, forty thousand Dothraki warriors and \\nuncounted numbers of women, children, and slaves. Outside the city walls they camped with their vast \\nherds, raising palaces of woven grass, eating everything in sight, and making the good folk of Pentos \\nmore anxious with every passing day. \\n\"My fellow magisters; have doubled the size of the city guard,\" Illyrio told them over platters of honey \\nduck and orange snap peppers one night at the manse that had been Drogo\\'s. The khal had joined his \\nkhalasar, his estate given over to Daenerys and her brother until the wedding. \\n\"Best we get Princess Daenerys wedded quickly before they hand half the wealth of Pentos away to \\nsellswords and bravos,\" Ser Jorah Mormont jested. The exile had offered her brother his sword the night \\nDany had been sold to Kbal Drogo; Viserys had accepted eagerly. Mormont had been their constant \\ncompanion ever since. \\nMagister Illyrio laughed lightly through his forked beard, but Viserys did not so much as smile. \"He can \\nhave her tomorrow, if he \\nlikes,\" her brother said. He glanced over at Dany, and she lowered her eyes. \"So long as he pays the \\nprice.\" \\nIllyrio waved a languid hand in the air, rings glittering on his fat fingers. \"I have told you, all is settled. \\nTrust me. The khal has promised you a crown, and you shall have it.\" \\n\"Yes, but when?\" \\n\"When the khal chooses,\" Illyrio said. \"He will have the girl first, and after they are wed he must make his \\nprocession across the plains and present her to the dosh khaleen at Vaes Dolthrak. After that, perhaps. If \\nthe omens favor war.\" \\nViserys seethed with impatience. \"I piss on Dothraki omens. The Usurper sits on my father\\'s throne. \\nHow long must I wait?\" \\nIllyrio gave a massive shrug. \"You have waited most of your life, great king. What is another few months, \\nanother few years?\" \\nSer Jorah, who had traveled as far east as Vaes Dothrak, nodded in agreement. \"I counsel you to be \\npatient, Your Grace. The Dothraki are true to their word, but they do things in their own time. A lesser \\nman may beg a favor from the khal, but must never presume to berate him.\" \\nViserys bristled. \"Guard your tongue, Mormont, or I\\'ll have it out. I am no lesser man, I am the rightful \\nLord of the Seven Kingdoms. The dragon does not beg.\" \\nSer Jorah lowered his eyes respectfully. Illyrio smiled enigmatically and tore a wing from the duck. \\nHoney and grease ran over his fingers and dripped down into his beard as he nibbled at the tender meat. \\n  65\\n\\nThere are no more dragons, Dany thought, staring at her brother, though she did not dare say it aloud. \\nYet that night she dreamt of one. Viserys was hitting her, hurting her. She was naked, clumsy with fear. \\nShe ran from him, but her body seemed thick and ungainly. He struck her again. She stumbled and fell. \\n\"You woke the dragon,\" he screamed as he kicked her. \"You woke the dragon, you woke the dragon.\" \\nHer thighs were slick with blood. She closed her eyes and whimpered. As if in answer, there was a \\nhideous ripping sound and the crackling of some great fire. When she looked again, Viserys was gone, \\ngreat columns of flame rose all around, and in the midst of them was the dragon. It turned its great head \\nslowly. When its molten eyes found hers, she woke, shaking and covered with a fine sheen of sweat. She \\nhad never been so afraid . . . \\n. . . until the day of her wedding came at last. \\nThe ceremony began at dawn and continued until dusk, an endless day of drinking and feasting and \\nfighting. A mighty earthen ramp had been raised amid the grass palaces, and there Dany was seated \\nbeside \\nKhal Drogo, above the seething sea of Dothraki. She had never seen so many people in one place, nor \\npeople so strange and frightening. The horselords might put on rich fabrics and sweet perfumes when \\nthey visited the Free Cities, but out under the open sky they kept the old ways. Men and women alike \\nwore painted leather vests over bare chests and horsehair leggings cinched by bronze medallion belts, \\nand the warriors greased their long braids with fat from the rendering pits. They gorged themselves on \\nhorseflesh roasted with honey and peppers, drank themselves blind on fermented mare\\'s milk and Illyrio\\'s \\nfine wines, and spat jests at each other across the fires, their voices harsh and alien in Dany\\'s ears. \\nViserys was seated just below her, splendid in a new black wool tunic with a scarlet dragon on the \\nchest. Illyrio and Ser Jorah sat beside him. Theirs was a place of high honor, just below the khal\\'s own \\nbloodriders, but Dany could see the anger in her brother\\'s lilac eyes. He did not like sitting beneath her, \\nand he fumed when the slaves offered each dish first to the khal and his bride, and served him from the \\nportions they refused. He could do nothing but nurse his resentment, so nurse it he did, his mood growing \\nblacker by the hour at each insult to his person. \\nDany had never felt so alone as she did seated in the midst of that vast horde. Her brother had told her \\nto smile, and so she smiled until her face ached and the tears came unbidden to her eyes. She did her \\nbest to hide them, knowing how angry Viserys would be if he saw her crying, terrified of how Khal \\nDrogo might react. Food was brought to her, steaming joints of meat and thick black sausages and \\nDothraki blood pies, and later fruits and sweetgrass stews and delicate pastries from the kitchens of \\nPentos, but she waved it all away. Her stomach was a roil, and she knew she could keep none of it \\ndown. \\nThere was no one to talk to. Khal Drogo shouted commands and jests down to his bloodriders, and \\nlaughed at their replies, but he scarcely glanced at Dany beside him. They had no common language. \\nDothraki was incomprehensible to her, and the khal knew only a few words of the bastard Valyrian of \\nthe Free Cities, and none at all of the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms. She would even have \\nwelcomed the conversation of Illyrio and her brother, but they were too far below to hear her. \\nSo she sat in her wedding silks, nursing a cup of honeyed wine, afraid to eat, talking silently to herself. I \\nam blood of the dragon, she told herself. I am Daenerys Stormborn, Princess of Dragonstone, of the \\nblood and seed of Aegon the Conqueror. \\nThe sun was only a quarter of the way up the sky when she saw her \\n  66\\n\\nfirst man die. Drums were beating as some of the women danced for the khal. Drogo watched without \\nexpression, but his eyes followed their movements, and from time to time he would toss down a bronze \\nmedallion for the women to fight over. \\nThe warriors were watching too. One of them finally stepped into the circle, grabbed a dancer by the \\narm, pushed her down to the ground, and mounted her right there, as a stallion mounts a mare. Illyrio had \\ntold her that might happen. \"The Dothraki mate like the animals in their herds. There is no privacy in a \\nkhalasar, and they do not understand sin or shame as we do.\" \\nDany looked away from the coupling, frightened when she realized what was happening, but a second \\nwarrior stepped forward, and a third, and soon there was no way to avert her eyes. Then two men \\nseized the same woman. She heard a shout, saw a shove, and in the blink of an eye the arakhs were out, \\nlong razor-sharp blades, half sword and half scythe. A dance of death began as the warriors circled and \\nslashed, leaping toward each other, whirling the blades around their heads, shrieking insults at each clash. \\nNo one made a move to interfere. \\nIt ended as quickly as it began. The arakhs shivered together faster than Dany could follow, one man \\nmissed a step, the other swung his blade in a flat arc. Steel bit into flesh just above the Dothraki\\'s waist, \\nand opened him from backbone to belly button, spilling his entrails into the dust. As the loser died, the \\nwinner took hold of the nearest woman-not even the one they had been quarreling over-and had her \\nthere and then. Slaves carried off the body, and the dancing resumed. \\nMagister Illyrio had warned Dany about this too. \"A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is \\ndeemed a dull affair,\" he had said. Her wedding must have been especially blessed; before the day was \\nover, a dozen men had died. \\nAs the hours passed, the terror grew in Dany, until it was all she could do not to scream. She was afraid \\nof the Dothraki, whose ways seemed alien and monstrous, as if they were beasts in human skins and not \\ntrue men at all. She was afraid of her brother, of what he might do if she failed him. Most of all, she was \\nafraid of what would happen tonight under the stars, when her brother gave her up to the hulking giant \\nwho sat drinking beside her with a face as still and cruel as a bronze mask. \\nI am the blood of the dragon, she told herself again. \\nWhen at last the sun was low in the sky, Khal Drogo clapped his hands together, and the drums and the \\nshouting and feasting came to a \\nsudden halt. Drogo stood and pulled Dany to her feet beside him. It was time for her bride gifts. \\nAnd after the gifts, she knew, after the sun had gone down, it would be time for the first ride and the \\nconsummation of her marriage. Dany tried to put the thought aside, but it would not leave her. She \\nhugged herself to try to keep from shaking. \\nHer brother Viserys gifted her with three handmaids. Dany knew they had cost him nothing; Illyrio no \\ndoubt had provided the girls. Irri and Jhiqui were copper-skinned Dothraki with black hair and \\nalmondshaped eyes, Doreah a fair-haired, blue-eyed Lysene girl. \"These are no common servants, sweet \\nsister,\" her brother told her as they were brought forward one by one. \"Illyrio and I selected them \\npersonally for you. Irri will teach you riding, Jhiqui the Dothraki tongue, and Doreah will instruct you in \\nthe womanly arts of love.\" He smiled thinly. \"She\\'s very good, Illyrio and I can both swear to that.\" \\n  67\\n\\nSer Jorah Mormont apologized for his gift. \"It is a small thing, my princess, but all a poor exile could \\nafford,\" he said as he laid a small stack of old books before her. They were histories and songs of the \\nSeven Kingdoms, she saw, written in the Common Tongue. She thanked him with all her heart. \\nMagister Illyrio murmured a command, and four burly slaves hurried forward, bearing between them a \\ngreat cedar chest bound in bronze. When she opened it, she found piles of the finest velvets and damasks \\nthe Free Cities could produce . . . and resting on top, nestled in the soft cloth, three huge eggs. Dany \\ngasped. They were the most beautiful things she had ever seen, each different than the others, patterned \\nin such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels, and so large it took both of her \\nhands to hold one. She lifted it delicately, expecting that it would be made of some fine porcelain or \\ndelicate enamel, or even blown glass, but it was much heavier than that, as if it were all of solid stone. \\nThe surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales, and as she turned the egg between her fingers, they \\nshimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun. One egg was a deep green, with burnished \\nbronze flecks that came and went depending on how Dany turned it. Another was pale cream streaked \\nwith gold. The last was black, as black as a midnight sea, yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls. \"What \\nare they?\" she asked, her voice hushed and full of wonder. \\n\"Dragon\\'s eggs, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai,\" said Magister Illyrio. \"The eons have turned \\nthem to stone, yet still they burn bright with beauty.\" \\n\"I shall treasure them always.\" Dany had heard tales of such eggs, \\nbut she had never seen one, nor thought to see one. It was a truly magnificent gift, though she knew that \\nIllyrio could afford to be lavish. He had collected a fortune in horses and slaves for his part in selling her \\nto Khal Drogo. \\nThe khal\\'s bloodriders offered her the traditional three weapons, and splendid weapons they were. \\nHaggo gave her a great leather whip with a silver handle, Cohollo a magnificent arakh chased in gold, and \\nQotho a double-curved dragonbone bow taller than she was. Magister Illyrio and Ser Jorah had taught \\nher the traditional refusals for these offerings. \"This is a gift worthy of a great warrior, 0 blood of my \\nblood, and I am but a woman. Let my lord husband bear these in my stead.\" And so Khal Drogo too \\nreceived his \"bride gifts.\" \\nOther gifts she was given in plenty by other Dothraki: slippers and jewels and silver rings for her hair, \\nmedallion belts and painted vests and soft furs, sandsilks and jars of scent, needles and feathers and tiny \\nbottles of purple glass, and a gown made from the skin of a thousand mice. \"A handsome gift, Khaleesi,\" \\nMagister Illyrio said of the last, after he had told her what it was. \"Most lucky.\" The gifts mounted up \\naround her in great piles, more gifts than she could possibly imagine, more gifts than she could want or \\nuse. \\nAnd last of all, Khal Drogo brought forth his own bride gift to her. An expectant hush rippled out from \\nthe center of the camp as he left her side, growing until it had swallowed the whole khalasar. When he \\nreturned, the dense press of Dothraki gift-givers parted before him, and he led the horse to her. \\nShe was a young filly, spirited and splendid. Dany knew just enough about horses to know that this was \\nno ordinary animal. There was something about her that took the breath away. She was grey as the \\nwinter sea, with a mane like silver smoke. \\nHesitantly she reached out and stroked the horse\\'s neck, ran her fingers through the silver of her mane. \\nKhal Drogo said something in Dothraki and Magister Illyrio translated. \"Silver for the silver of your hair, \\nthe khal says.\" \\n  68\\n\\n\"She\\'s beautiful,\" Dany murmured. \\n\"She is the pride of the khalasar, \" Illyrio said. \"Custom decrees that the khaleesi must ride a mount \\nworthy of her place by the side of the khaL \" \\nDrogo stepped forward and put his hands on her waist. He lifted her up as easily as if she were a child \\nand set her on the thin Dothraki saddle, so much smaller than the ones she was used to. Dany sat there \\nuncertain for a moment. No one had told her about this part. \"What should I do?\" she asked Illyrio. \\nIt was Ser Jorah Mormont who answered. \"Take the reins and ride. You need not go far.\" \\nNervously Dany gathered the reins.in her hands and slid her feet into the short stirrups. She was only a \\nfair rider; she had spent far more time traveling by ship and wagon and palanquin than by horseback. \\nPraying that she would not fall off and disgrace herself, she gave the filly the lightest and most timid touch \\nwith her knees. \\nAnd for the first time in hours, she forgot to be afraid. Or perhaps it was for the first time ever. \\nThe silver-grey filly moved with a smooth and silken gait, and the crowd parted for her, every eye upon \\nthem. Dany found herself moving faster than she had intended, yet somehow it was exciting rather than \\nterrifying. The horse broke into a trot, and she smiled. Dothraki scrambled to clear a path. The slightest \\npressure with her legs, the lightest touch on the reins, and the filly responded. She sent it into a gallop, \\nand now the Dothraki were hooting and laughing and shouting at her as they jumped out of her way. As \\nshe turned to ride back, a firepit loomed ahead, directly in her path. They were hemmed in on either side, \\nwith no room to stop. A daring she had never known filled Daenerys then, and she gave the filly her \\nhead. \\nThe silver horse leapt the flames as if she had wings. \\nWhen she pulled up before Magister Illyrio, she said, \"Tell Khal Drogo that he has given me the wind.\" \\nThe fat Pentoshi stroked his yellow beard as he repeated her words in Dothraki, and Dany saw her new \\nhusband smile for the first time. \\nThe last sliver of sun vanished behind the high walls of Pentos to the west just then. Dany had lost all \\ntrack of time. Khal Drogo commanded his bloodriders to bring forth his own horse, a lean red stallion. \\nAs the khal was saddling the horse, Viserys slid close to Dany on her silver, dug his fingers into her leg, \\nand said, \"Please him, sweet sister, or I swear, you will see the dragon wake as it has never woken \\nbefore.\" \\nThe fear came back to her then, with her brother\\'s words. She felt like a child once more, only thirteen \\nand all alone, not ready for what was about to happen to her. \\nThey rode out together as the stars came out, leaving the khalasar and the grass palaces behind. Khal \\nDrogo spoke no word to her, but drove his stallion at a hard trot through the gathering dusk. The tiny \\nsilver bells in his long braid rang softly as he rode. \"I am the blood of the dragon,\" she whispered aloud as \\nshe followed, trying to keep her courage up. \"I am the blood of the dragon. I am the blood of the \\ndragon.\" The dragon was never afraid. \\nAfterward she could not say how far or how long they had ridden, but it was full dark when they \\nstopped at a grassy place beside a small stream. Drogo swung off his horse and lifted her down from \\n  69\\n\\nhers. She felt as fragile as glass in his hands, her limbs as weak as water. She stood there helpless and \\ntrembling in her wedding silks while he secured the horses, and when he turned to look at her, she began \\nto cry. \\nKhal Drogo stared at her tears, his face strangely empty of expression. \"No,\" he said. He lifted his hand \\nand rubbed away the tears roughly with a callused thumb. \\n\"You speak the Common Tongue,\" Dany said in wonder. \\n\"No,\" he said again. \\nPerhaps he had only that word, she thought, but it was one word more than she had known he had, and \\nsomehow it made her feel a little better. Drogo touched her hair lightly, sliding the silver-blond strands \\nbetween his fingers and murmuring softly in Dothraki. Dany did not understand the words, yet there was \\nwarmth in the tone, a tenderness she had never expected from this man. \\nHe put his finger under her chin and lifted her head, so she was looking up into his eyes. Drogo towered \\nover her as he towered over everyone. Taking her lightly under the arms, he lifted her and seated her on \\na rounded rock beside the stream. Then he sat on the ground facing her, legs crossed beneath him, their \\nfaces finally at a height. \"No,\" he said. \\n\"Is that the only word you know?\" she asked him. \\nDrogo did not reply. His long heavy braid was coiled in the dirt beside him. He pulled it over his right \\nshoulder and began to remove the bells from his hair, one by one. After a moment Dany leaned forward \\nto help. When they were done, Drogo gestured. She understood. Slowly, carefully, she began to undo \\nhis braid. \\nIt took a long time. All the while he sat there silently, watching her. When she was done, he shook his \\nhead, and his hair spread out behind him like a river of darkness, oiled and gleaming. She had never seen \\nhair so long, so black, so thick. \\nThen it was his turn. He began to undress her. \\nHis fingers were deft and strangely tender. He removed her silks one by one, carefully, while Dany sat \\nunmoving, silent, looking at his eyes. When he bared her small breasts, she could not help herself. She \\naverted her eyes and covered herself with her hands. \"No,\" Drogo said. He pulled her hands away from \\nher breasts, gently but firmly, then lifted her face again to make her look at him. \"No,\" he repeated. \\n\"No,\" she echoed back at him. \\nHe stood her up then and pulled her close to remove the last of her \\nsilks. The night air was chilly on her bare skin. She shivered, and gooseflesh covered her arms and legs. \\nShe was afraid of what would come next, but for a while nothing happened. Khal Drogo sat with his legs \\ncrossed, looking at her, drinking in her body with his eyes. \\nAfter a while he began to touch her. Lightly at first, then harder. She could sense the fierce strength in his \\nhands, but he never hurt her. He held her hand in his own and brushed her fingers, one by one. He ran a \\nhand gently down her leg. He stroked her face, tracing the curve of her ears, running a finger gently \\naround her mouth. He put both hands in her hair and combed it with his fingers. He turned her around, \\n  70\\n\\nmassaged her shoulders, slid a knuckle down the path of her spine. \\nIt seemed as if hours passed before his hands finally went to her breasts. He stroked the soft skin \\nunderneath until it tingled. He circled her nipples with his thumbs, pinched them between thumb and \\nforefinger, then began to pull at her, very lightly at first, then more insistently, until her nipples stiffened \\nand began to ache. \\nHe stopped then, and drew her down onto his lap. Dany was flushed and breathless, her heart fluttering \\nin her chest. He cupped her face in his huge hands and looked into his eyes. \"No?\" he said, and she knew \\nit was a question. \\nShe took his hand and moved it down to the wetness between her thighs. \"Yes,\" she whispered as she \\nput his finger inside her. \\nEDDARD \\nThe summons came in the hour before the dawn, when the world was still and grey. \\nAlyn shook him roughly from his dreams and Ned stumbled into the predawn chill, groggy from sleep, to \\nfind his horse saddled and the king already mounted. Robert wore thick brown gloves and a heavy fur \\ncloak with a hood that covered his ears, and looked for all the world like a bear sitting a horse. \"Up, \\nStark!\" he roared. \"Up, up! We have matters of state to discuss.\" \\n\"By all means,\" Ned said. \"Come inside, Your Grace.\" Alyn lifted the flap of the tent. \\n\"No, no, no,\" Robert said. His breath steamed with every word. \"The camp is full of ears. Besides, I \\nwant to ride out and taste this country of yours.\" Ser Boros and Ser Meryn waited behind him with a \\ndozen guardsmen, Ned saw. There was nothing to do but rub the sleep from his eyes, dress, and mount \\nup. \\nRobert set the pace, driving his huge black destrier hard as Ned galloped along beside him, trying to \\nkeep up. He called out a question as they rode, but the wind blew his words away, and the king did not \\nhear him. After that Ned rode in silence. They soon left the kingsroad and took off across rolling plains \\ndark with mist. By then the guard had fallen back a small distance, safely out of earshot, but still Robert \\nwould not slow. \\nDawn broke as they crested a low ridge, and finally the king pulled up. By then they were miles south of \\nthe main party. Robert was flushed and exhilarated as Ned reined up beside him. \"Gods,\" he swore, \\nlaughing, \"it feels good to get out and tide the way a man was meant to ride! I swear, Ned, this creeping \\nalong is enough to drive a man mad.\" He had never been a patient man, Robert Baratheon. \"That \\ndamnable wheelhouse, the way it creaks and groans, climbing every bump in the road as if it were a \\nmountain . . . I promise you, if that wretched thing breaks another axle, I\\'m going to burn it, and Cersei \\ncan walk!\" \\nNed laughed. \"I will gladly light the torch for you.\" \\n\"Good man!\" The king clapped him on the shoulder. \"I\\'ve half a mind to leave them all behind and just \\nkeep going.\" \\n  71\\n\\nA smile touched Ned\\'s lips. \"I do believe you mean it.\" \\n\"I do, I do,\" the king said. \"What do you say, Ned? Just you and me, two vagabond knights on the \\nkingsroad, our swords at our sides and the gods know what in front of us, and maybe a farmer\\'s \\ndaughter or a tavern wench to warm our beds tonight.\" \\n\"Would that we could,\" Ned said, \"but we have duties now, my liege . . . to the realm, to our children, I \\nto my lady wife and you to your queen. We are not the boys we were.\" \\n\"You were never the boy you were,\" Robert grumbled. \"More\\'s the pity. And yet there was that one \\ntime . . . what was her name, that common girl of yours? Becca? No, she was one of mine, gods love \\nher, black hair and these sweet big eyes, you could drown in them. Yours was . . . Aleena? No. You told \\nme once. Was it Merryl? You know the one I mean, your bastard\\'s mother?\" \\n\"Her name was Wylla,\" Ned replied with cool courtesy, \"and I would sooner not speak of her.\" \\n\"Wylla. Yes.\" The king grinned. \"She must have been a rare wench if she could make Lord Eddard \\nStark forget his honor, even for an hour. You never told me what she looked like . . .\" \\nNed\\'s mouth tightened in anger. \"Nor will 1. Leave it be, Robert, for the love you say you bear me. I \\ndishonored myself and I dishonored Catelyn, in the sight of gods and men.\" \\n\"Gods have mercy, you scarcely knew Catelyn.\" \\n\"I had taken her to wife. She was carrying my child.\" \\n\"You are too hard on yourself, Ned. You always were. Damn it, no woman wants Baelor the Blessed in \\nher bed.\" He slapped a hand on his knee. \"Well, I\\'ll not press you if you feel so strong about it, though I \\nswear, at times you\\'re so prickly you ought to take the hedgehog as your sigil.\" \\nThe rising sun sent fingers of light through the pale white mists of dawn. A wide plain spread out beneath \\nthem, bare and brown, its flatness here and there relieved by long, low hummocks. Ned pointed them out \\nto his king. \"The barrows of the First Men.\" \\nRobert frowned. \"Have we ridden onto a graveyard?\" \\n\"There are barrows everywhere in the north, Your Grace,\" Ned told him. \"This land is old.\" \\n\"And cold,\" Robert grumbled, pulling his cloak more tightly around himself. The guard had reined up well \\nbehind them, at the bottom of the ridge. \"Well, I did not bring you out here to talk of graves or bicker \\nabout your bastard. There was a rider in the night, from Lord Varys in King\\'s Landing. Here.\" The king \\npulled a paper from his belt and handed it to Ned. \\nVarys the eunuch was the king\\'s master of whisperers. He served Robert now as he had once served \\nAerys Targaryen. Ned unrolled the paper with trepidation, thinking of Lysa and her terrible accusation, \\nbut the message did not concern Lady Arryn. \"What is the source for this information?\" \\n\"Do you remember Ser Jorah Mormont?\" \\n\"Would that I might forget him,\" Ned said bluntly. The Mormonts of Bear Island were an old house, \\nproud and honorable, but their lands were cold and distant and poor. Ser Jorah had tried to swell the \\n  72\\n\\nfamily coffers by selling some poachers to a Tyroshi slaver. As the Mormonts were bannermen to the \\nStarks, his crime had dishonored the north. Ned had made the long journey west to Bear Island, only to \\nfind when he arrived that Jorah had taken ship beyond the reach of Ice and the king\\'s justice. Five years \\nhad passed since then. \\n\"Ser Jorah is now in Pentos, anxious to earn a royal pardon that would allow him to return from exile,\" \\nRobert explained. \"Lord Varys makes good use of him.\" \\n\"So the slaver has become a spy,\" Ned said with distaste. He handed the letter back. \"I would rather he \\nbecome a corpse.\" \\n\"Varys tells me that spies are more useful than corpses,\" Robert said. \"Jorah aside, what do you make of \\nhis report?\" \\n\"Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Shall we send her a wedding gift?\" \\nThe king frowned. \"A knife, perhaps. A good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.\" \\nNed did not feign surprise; Robert\\'s hatred of the Targaryens was a madness in him. He remembered \\nthe angry words they had exchanged when Tywin Lannister had presented Robert with the corpses of \\nRhaegar\\'s wife and children as a token of fealty. Ned had named that \\n100 GLORGE R.R. MARTIN \\nmurder; Robert called it war. When he had protested that the young prince and princess were no more \\nthan babes, his new-made king had replied, \"I see no babes. Only dragonspawn.\" Not even Jon Arryn \\nhad been able to calm that storm. Eddard Stark had ridden out that very day in a cold rage, to fight the \\nlast battles of the war alone in the south. It had taken another death to reconcile them; Lyanna\\'s death, \\nand the grief they had shared over her passing. \\nThis time, Ned resolved to keep his temper. \"Your Grace, the girl is scarcely more than a child. You are \\nno Tywin Lannister, to slaughter innocents.\" It was said that Rhaegar\\'s little girl had cried as they dragged \\nher from beneath her bed to face the swords. The boy had been no more than a babe in arms, yet Lord \\nTywin\\'s soldiers had torn him from his mother\\'s breast and dashed his head against a wall. \\n\"And how long will this one remain an innocent?\" Robert\\'s mouth grew hard. \"This child will soon enough \\nspread her legs and start breeding more dragonspawn to plague me.\" \\n\"Nonetheless,\" Ned said, \"the murder of children . . . it would be vile . . . unspeakable . . .\" \\n\"Unspeakable?\" the king roared. \"What Aerys did to your brother Brandon was unspeakable. The way \\nyour lord father died, that was unspeakable. And Rhaegar . . . how many times do you think he raped \\nyour sister? How many hundreds of times?\" His voice had grown so loud that his horse whinnied \\nnervously beneath him. The king jerked the reins hard, quieting the animal, and pointed an angry finger at \\nNed. \"I will kill every Targaryen I can get my hands on, until they are as dead as their dragons, and then I \\nwill piss on their graves.\" \\nNed knew better than to defy him when the wrath was on him. If the years had not quenched Robert\\'s \\nthirst for revenge, no words of his would help. \"You can\\'t get your hands on this one, can you?\" he said \\nquietly. \\n  73\\n\\nThe king\\'s mouth twisted in a bitter grimace. \"No, gods be cursed. Some pox-ridden Pentoshi \\ncheesemonger had her brother and her walled up on his estate with pointy-hatted eunuchs all around \\nthem, and now he\\'s handed them over to the Dothraki. I should have had them both killed years ago, \\nwhen it was easy to get at them, but Jon was as bad as you. More fool 1, 1 listened to him.\" \\n\"Jon Arryn was a wise man and a good Hand.\" \\nRobert snorted. The anger was leaving him as suddenly as it had come. \"This Khal Drogo is said to have \\na hundred thousand men in his horde. What would Jon say to that?\" \\n\"He would say that even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, so long as they remain on the \\nother side of the narrow sea,\" \\nNed replied calmly. \"The barbarians have no ships. They hate and fear the open sea.\" \\nThe king shifted uncomfortably in his saddle. \"Perhaps. There are ships to be had in the Free Cities, \\nthough. I tell you, Ned, I do not like this marriage. There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call \\nme Usurper. Do you forget how many houses fought for Targaryen in the war? They bide their time for \\nnow, but give them half a chance, they will murder me in my bed, and my sons with me. If the beggar \\nking crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the traitors will join him.\" \\n\"He will not cross,\" Ned promised. \"And if by some mischance he does, we will throw him back into the \\nsea. Once you choose a new Warden of the East-\" \\nThe king groaned. \"For the last time, I will not name the Arryn boy Warden. I know the boy is your \\nnephew, but with Targaryens climbing in bed with Dothraki, I would be mad to rest one quarter of the \\nrealm on the shoulders of a sickly child.\" \\nNed was ready for that. \"Yet we still must have a Warden of the East. If Robert Arryn will not do, name \\none of your brothers. Stannis proved himself at the siege of Storm\\'s End, surely.\" \\nHe let the name hang there for a moment. The king frowned and said nothing. He looked uncomfortable. \\n\"That is,\" Ned finished quietly, watching, \"unless you have already promised the honor to another.\" \\nFor a moment Robert had the grace to look startled. Just as quickly, the look became annoyance. \\n\"What if I have?\" \\n\"It\\'s Jaime Lannister, is it not?\" \\nRobert kicked his horse back into motion and started down the ridge toward the barrows. Ned kept \\npace with him. The king rode on, eyes straight ahead. \"Yes,\" he said at last. A single hard word to end \\nthe matter. \\n\"Kingslayer,\" Ned said. The rumors were true, then. He rode on dangerous ground now, he knew. \"An \\nable and courageous man, no doubt,\" he said carefully, \"but his father is Warden of the West, Robert. In \\ntime Ser Jaime will succeed to that honor. No one man should hold both East and West.\" He left unsaid \\nhis real concern; that the appointment would put half the armies of the realm into the hands of Lannisters. \\n  74\\n\\n\"I will fight that battle when the enemy appears on the field,\" the king said stubbornly. \"At the moment, \\nLord Tywin looms eternal as Casterly Rock, so I doubt that Jaime will be succeeding anytime soon. \\nDon\\'t vex me about this, Ned, the stone has been set.\" \\n\"Your Grace, may I speak frankly?\" \\n\"I seem unable to stop you,\" Robert grumbled. They rode through tall brown grasses. \\n\"Can you trust Jaime Lannister?\" \\n\"He is my wife\\'s twin, a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard, his life and fortune and honor all bound to \\nmine.\" \\n\"As they were bound to Aerys Targaryen\\'s,\" Ned pointed out. \\n\"Why should I mistrust him? He has done everything I have ever asked of him. His sword helped win the \\nthrone I sit on.\" \\nHis sword helped taint the throne you sit on, Ned thought, but he did not permit the words to pass his \\nlips. \"He swore a vow to protect his king\\'s life with his own. Then he opened that king\\'s throat with a \\nsword.\" \\n\"Seven hells, someone had to kill Aerys!\" Robert said, reining his mount to a sudden halt beside an \\nancient barrow. \"If Jaime hadn\\'t done it, it would have been left for you or me.\" \\n\"We were not Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard,\" Ned said. The time had come for Robert to hear the \\nwhole truth, he decided then and there. \"Do you remember the Trident, Your Grace?\" \\n\"I won my crown there. How should I forget it?\" \\n\"You took a wound from Rhaegar,\" Ned reminded him. \"So when the Targaryen host broke and ran, \\nyou gave the pursuit into my hands. The remnants of Rhaegar\\'s army fled back to King\\'s Landing. We \\nfollowed. Aerys was in the Red Keep with several thousand loyalists. I expected to find the gates closed \\nto us.\" \\nRobert gave an impatient shake of his head. \"Instead you found that our men had already taken the city. \\nWhat of it?\" \\n\"Not our men,\" Ned said patiently. \"Lannister men. The lion of Lannister flew over the ramparts, not the \\ncrowned stag. And they had taken the city by treachery.\" \\nThe war had raged for close to a year. Lords great and small had flocked to Robert\\'s banners; others \\nhad remained loyal to Targaryen. The mighty Lannisters of Casterly Rock, the Wardens of the West, had \\nremained aloof from the struggle, ignoring calls to arms from both rebels and royalists. Aerys Targaryen \\nmust have thought that his gods had answered his prayers when Lord Tywin Lannister appeared before \\nthe gates of King\\'s Landing with an army twelve thousand strong, professing loyalty. So the mad king had \\nordered his last mad act. He had opened his city to the lions at the gate. \\n\"Treachery was a coin the Targaryens knew well,\" Robert said. The anger was building in him again. \\n  75\\n\\n\"Lannister paid them back in kind. It was no less than they deserved. I shall not trouble my sleep over it.\" \\n\"You were not there,\" Ned said, bitterness in his voice. Troubled \\nsleep was no stranger to him. He had lived his lies for fourteen years, yet they still haunted him at night. \\n\"There was no honor in that conquest.\" \\n\"The Others take your honor!\" Robert swore. \"What did any Targaryen ever know of honor? Go down \\ninto your crypt and ask Lyanna about the dragon\\'s honor!\" \\n\"You avenged Lyanna at the Trident,\" Ned said, halting beside the king. Promise me, Ned, she had \\nwhispered. \\n\"That did not bring her back.\" Robert looked away, off into the grey distance. \"The gods be damned. It \\nwas a hollow victory they gave me. A crown . . . it was the girl I prayed them for. Your sister, safe . . . \\nand mine again, as she was meant to be. I ask you, Ned, what good is it to wear a crown? The gods \\nmock the prayers of kings and cowherds alike.\" \\n\"I cannot answer for the gods, Your Grace . . . only for what I found when I rode into the throne room \\nthat day,\" Ned said. \"Aerys was dead on the floor, drowned in his own blood. His dragon skulls stared \\ndown from the walls. Lannister\\'s men were everywhere. Jaime wore the white cloak of the Kingsguard \\nover his golden armor. I can see him still. Even his sword was gilded. He was seated on the Iron Throne, \\nhigh above his knights, wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lion\\'s head. How he glittered!\" \\n\"This is well known,\" the king complained. \\n\"I was still mounted. I rode the length of the hall in silence, between the long rows of dragon skulls. It felt \\nas though they were watching me, somehow. I stopped in front of the throne, looking up at him. His \\ngolden sword was across his legs, its edge red with a king\\'s blood. My men were filling the room behind \\nme. Lannister\\'s men drew back. I never said a word. I looked at him seated there on the throne, and I \\nwaited. At last Jaime laughed and got up. He took off his helm, and he said to me, \\'Have no fear, Stark. I \\nwas only keeping it warm for our friend Robert. It\\'s not a very comfortable seat, I\\'m afraid.\\' \" \\nThe king threw back his head and roared. His laughter startled a flight of crows from the tall brown \\ngrass. They took to the air in a wild beating of wings. \"You think I should mistrust Lannister because he \\nsat on my throne for a few moments?\" He shook with laughter again. \"Jaime was all of seventeen, Ned. \\nScarce more than a boy.\" \\n\"Boy or man, he had no right to that throne.\" \\n\"Perhaps he was tired,\" Robert suggested. \"Killing kings is weary work. Gods know, there\\'s no place \\nelse to rest your ass in that damnable room. And he spoke truly, it is a monstrous uncomfortable chair. In \\nmore ways than one.\" The king shook his head. \"Well, now I know \\nJaime\\'s dark sin, and the matter can be forgotten. I am heartily sick of secrets and squabbles and matters \\nof state, Ned. It\\'s all as tedious as counting coppers. Come, let\\'s ride, you used to know how. I want to \\nfeel the wind in my hair again.\" He kicked his horse back into motion and galloped up over the barrow, \\n  76\\n\\nraining earth down behind him. \\nFor a moment Ned did not follow. He had run out of words, and he was filled with a vast sense of \\nhelplessness. Not for the first time, he wondered what he was doing here and why he had come. He was \\nno Jon Arryn, to curb the wildness of his king and teach him wisdom. Robert would do what he pleased, \\nas he always had, and nothing Ned could say or do would change that. He belonged in Winterfell. He \\nbelonged with Catelyn in her grief, and with Bran. \\nA man could not always be where he belonged, though. Resigned, Eddard Stark put his boots into his \\nhorse and set off after the king. \\nTYRION \\nThe north went on forever. \\nTyrion Lannister knew the maps as well as anyone, but a fortnight on the wild track that passed for the \\nkingsroad up here had brought home the lesson that the map was one thing and the land quite another. \\nThey had left Winterfell on the same day as the king, amidst all the commotion of the royal departure, \\nriding out to the sound of men shouting and horses snorting, to the rattle of wagons and the groaning of \\nthe queen\\'s huge wheelhouse, as a light snow flurried about them. The kingsroad was just beyond the \\nsprawl of castle and town. There the banners and the wagons and the columns of knights and freeriders \\nturned south, taking the tumult with them, while Tyrion turned north with Benjen Stark and his nephew. \\nIt had grown colder after that, and far more quiet. \\nWest of the road were flint hills, grey and rugged, with tall watchtowers on their stony summits. To the \\neast the land was lower, the ground flattening to a rolling plain that stretched away as far as the eye could \\nsee. Stone bridges spanned swift, narrow rivers, while small farms spread in rings around holdfasts \\nwalled in wood and stone. The road was well trafficked, and at night for their comfort there were rude \\ninns to be found. \\nThree days ride from Winterfell, however, the farmland gave way to \\ndense wood, and the kingsroad grew lonely. The flint hills rose higher and wilder with each passing mile, \\nuntil by the fifth day they had turned into mountains, cold blue-grey giants with jagged promontories and \\nsnow on their shoulders. When the wind blew from the north, long plumes of ice crystals flew from the \\nhigh peaks like banners. \\nWith the mountains a wall to the west, the road veered north by northeast through the wood, a forest of \\noak and evergreen and black brier that seemed older and darker than any Tyrion had ever seen. \"The \\nwolfswood,\" Benjen Stark called it, and indeed their nights came alive with the howls of distant packs, \\nand some not so distant. Jon Snow\\'s albino direwolf pricked up his ears at the nightly howling, but never \\nraised his own voice in reply. There was something very unsettling about that animal, Tyrion thought. \\n  77\\n\\nThere were eight in the party by then, not counting the wolf. Tyrion traveled with two of his own men, as \\nbefit a Lannister. Benjen Stark had only his bastard nephew and some fresh mounts for the Night\\'s \\nWatch, but at the edge of the wolfswood they stayed a night behind the wooden walls of a forest \\nholdfast, and there joined up with another of the black brothers, one Yoren. Yoren was stooped and \\nsinister, his features hidden behind a beard as black as his clothing, but he seemed as tough as an old root \\nand as hard as stone. With him were a pair of ragged peasant boys from the Fingers. \"Rapers,\" Yoren \\nsaid with a cold look at his charges. Tyrion understood. Life on the Wall was said to be hard, but no \\ndoubt it was preferable to castration. \\nFive men, three boys, a direwolf, twenty horses, and a cage of ravens given over to Benjen Stark by \\nMaester Luwin. No doubt they made a curious fellowship for the kingsroad, or any road. \\nTyrion noticed Jon Snow watching Yoren and his sullen companions, with an odd cast to his face that \\nlooked uncomfortably like dismay. Yoren had a twisted shoulder and a sour smell, his hair and beard \\nwere matted and greasy and full of lice, his clothing old, patched, and seldom washed. His two young \\nrecruits smelled even worse, and seemed as stupid as they were cruel. \\nNo doubt the boy had made the mistake of thinking that the Night\\'s Watch was made up of men like his \\nuncle. If so, Yoren and his companions were a rude awakening. Tyrion felt sorry for the boy. He had \\nchosen a hard life . . . or perhaps he should say that a hard life had been chosen for him. \\nHe had rather less sympathy for the uncle. Benjen Stark seemed to share his brother\\'s distaste for \\nLannisters, and he had not been pleased when Tyrion had told him of his intentions. \"I warn you, \\nLannister, you\\'ll find no inns at the Wall,\" he had said, looking down on him. \\n\"No doubt you\\'ll find some place to put me,\" Tyrion had replied. \"As you might have noticed, I\\'m small.\" \\nOne did not say no to the queen\\'s brother, of course, so that had settled the matter, but Stark had not \\nbeen happy. \"You will not like the ride, I promise you that,\" he\\'d said curtly, and since the moment they \\nset out, he had done all he could to live up to that promise. \\nBy the end of the first week, Tyrion\\'s thighs were raw from hard riding, his legs were cramping badly, \\nand he was chilled to the bone. He did not complain. He was damned if he would give Benjen Stark that \\nsatisfaction. \\nHe took a small revenge in the matter of his riding fur, a tattered bearskin, old and musty-smelling. Stark \\nhad offered it to him in an excess of Night\\'s Watch gallantry, no doubt expecting him to graciously \\ndecline. Tyrion had accepted with a smile. He had brought his warmest clothing with him when they rode \\nout of Winterfell, and soon discovered that it was nowhere near warm enough. It was cold up here, and \\ngrowing colder. The nights were well below freezing now, and when the wind blew it was like a knife \\ncutting right through his warmest woolens. By now Stark was no doubt regretting his chivalrous impulse. \\nPerhaps he had learned a lesson. The Lannisters never declined, graciously or otherwise. The Lannisters \\ntook what was offered. \\nFarms and holdfasts grew scarcer and smaller as they pressed northward, ever deeper into the darkness \\nof the wolfswood, until finally there were no more roofs to shelter under, and they were thrown back on \\ntheir own resources. \\n  78\\n\\nTyrion was never much use in making a camp or breaking one. Too small, too hobbled, too in-the-way. \\nSo while Stark and Yoren and the other men erected rude shelters, tended the horses, and built a fire, it \\nbecame his custom to take his fur and a wineskin and go off by himself to read. \\nOn the eighteenth night of their journey, the wine was a rare sweet amber from the Summer Isles that he \\nhad brought all the way north from Casterly Rock, and the book a rumination on the history and \\nproperties of dragons. With Lord Eddard Stark\\'s permission, Tyrion had borrowed a few rare volumes \\nfrom the Winterfell library and packed them for the ride north. \\nHe found a comfortable spot just beyond the noise of the camp, beside a swift-running stream with \\nwaters clear and cold as ice. A grotesquely ancient oak provided shelter from the biting wind. Tyrion \\ncurled up in his fur with his back against the trunk, took a sip of the \\nwine, and began to read about the properties of dragonbone. Dragonbone is black because of its high \\niron content, the book told him. It is strong as steel, yet lighter and far more flexible, and of course utterly \\nimpervious to fire. Dragonbone bows are greatly prized by the Dothraki, and small wonder. An archer so \\narmed can outrange any wooden bow. \\nTyrion had a morbid fascination with dragons. When he had first come to King\\'s Landing for his sister\\'s \\nwedding to Robert Baratheon, he had made it a point to seek out the dragon skulls that had hung on the \\nwalls of Targaryen\\'s throne room. King Robert had replaced them with banners and tapestries, but \\nTyrion had persisted until he found the skulls in the dank cellar where they had been stored. \\nHe had expected to find them impressive, perhaps even frightening. He had not thought to find them \\nbeautiful. Yet they were. As black as onyx, polished smooth, so the bone seemed to shimmer in the light \\nof his torch. They liked the fire, he sensed. He\\'d thrust the torch into the mouth of one of the larger skulls \\nand made the shadows leap and dance on the wall behind him. The teeth were long, curving knives of \\nblack diamond. The flame of the torch was nothing to them; they had bathed in the heat of far greater \\nfires. When he had moved away, Tyrion could have sworn that the beast\\'s empty eye sockets had \\nwatched him go. \\nThere were nineteen skulls. The oldest was more than three thousand years old; the youngest a mere \\ncentury and a half. The most recent were also the smallest; a matched pair no bigger than mastiffs skulls, \\nand oddly misshapen, all that remained of the last two hatchlings born on Dragonstone. They were the \\nlast of the Targaryen dragons, perhaps the last dragons anywhere, and they had not lived very long. \\nFrom there the skulls ranged upward in size to the three great monsters of song and story, the dragons \\nthat Aegon Targaryen and his sisters had unleashed on the Seven Kingdoms of old. The singers had given \\nthem the names of gods: Balerion, Meraxes, Vhaghar. Tyrion had stood between their gaping jaws, \\nwordless and awed. You could have ridden a horse down Vhaghar\\'s gullet, although you would not have \\nridden it out again. Meraxes was even bigger. And the greatest of them, Balerion, the Black Dread, could \\nhave swallowed an aurochs whole, or even one of the hairy mammoths said to roam the cold wastes \\nbeyond the Port of Ibben. \\nTyrion stood in that dank cellar for a long time, staring at Balerion\\'s huge, empty-eyed skull until his \\ntorch burned low, trying to grasp the size of the living animal, to imagine how it must have looked when it \\nspread its great black wings and swept across the skies, breathing fire. \\nA GAML OF THRONES 109 \\n  79\\n\\nHis own remote ancestor, King Loren of the Rock, had tried to stand against the fire when he joined \\nwith King Mern of the Reach to oppose the Targaryen conquest. That was close on three hundred years \\nago, when the Seven Kingdoms were kingdoms, and not mere provinces of a greater realm. Between \\nthem, the Two Kings had six hundred banners flying, five thousand mounted knights, and ten times as \\nmany freeriders and men-at-arms. Aegon Dragonlord had perhaps a fifth that number, the chroniclers \\nsaid, and most of those were conscripts from the ranks of the last king he had slain, their loyalties \\nuncertain. \\nThe hosts met on the broad plains of the Reach, amidst golden fields of wheat ripe for harvest. When the \\nTwo Kings charged, the Targaryen army shivered and shattered and began to run. For a few moments, \\nthe chroniclers wrote, the conquest was at an end . . . but only for those few moments, before Aegon \\nTargaryen and his sisters joined the battle. \\nIt was the only time that Vhaghar, Meraxes, and Balerion were all unleashed at once. The singers called \\nit the Field of Fire. \\nNear four thousand men had burned that day, among them King Mern of the Reach. King Loren had \\nescaped, and lived long enough to surrender, pledge his fealty to the Targaryens, and beget a son, for \\nwhich Tyrion was duly grateful. \\n\"Why do you read so much?\" \\nTyrion looked up at the sound of the voice. Jon Snow was standing a few feet away, regarding him \\ncuriously. He closed the book on a finger and said, \"Look at me and tell me what you see.\" \\nThe boy looked at him suspiciously. \"Is this some kind of trick? I see you. Tyrion Lannister.\" \\nTyrion sighed. \"You are remarkably polite for a bastard, Snow. What you see is a dwarf. You are what, \\ntwelve?\" \\n\"Fourteen,\" the boy said. \\n\"Fourteen, and you\\'re taller than I will ever be. My legs are short and twisted, and I walk with difficulty. \\nI require a special saddle to keep from falling off my horse. A saddle of my own design, you may be \\ninterested to know. It was either that or ride a pony. My arms are strong enough, but again, too short. I \\nwill never make a swordsman. Had I been born a peasant, they might have left me out to die, or sold me \\nto some slaver\\'s grotesquerie. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock, and the grotesqueries are \\nall the poorer. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for twenty years. My \\nbrother later killed that very same king, as it turns out, but life is full of these little ironies. My sister \\nmarried the new king and my \\nrepulsive nephew will be king after him. I must do my part for the honor of my House, wouldn\\'t you \\nagree? Yet how? Well, my legs may be too small for my body, but my head is too large, although I prefer \\nto think it is just large enough for my mind. I have a realistic grasp of my own strengths and weaknesses. \\nMy mind is my weapon. My brother has his sword, King Robert has his warhammer, and I have my \\nmind . . . and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge.\" Tyrion tapped \\nthe leather cover of the book. \"That\\'s why I read so much, Jon Snow.\" \\n  80\\n\\nThe boy absorbed that all in silence. He had the Stark face if not the name: long, solemn, guarded, a face \\nthat gave nothing away. Whoever his mother had been, she had left little of herself in her son. \"What are \\nyou reading about?\" he asked. \\n\"Dragons,\" Tyrion told him. \\n\"What good is that? There are no more dragons,\" the boy said with the easy certainty of youth. \\n\"So they say,\" Tyrion replied. \"Sad, isn\\'t it? When I was your age, used to dream of having a dragon of \\nmy own.\" \\n\"You did?\" the boy said suspiciously. Perhaps he thought Tyrion was making fun of him. \\n\"Oh, yes. Even a stunted, twisted, ugly little boy can look down over the world when he\\'s seated on a \\ndragon\\'s back.\" Tyrion pushed the bearskin aside and climbed to his feet. \"I used to start fires in the \\nbowels of Casterly Rock and stare at the flames for hours, pretending they were dragonfire. Sometimes \\nI\\'d imagine my father burning. At other times, my sister.\" Jon Snow was staring at him, a look equal parts \\nhorror and fascination. Tyrion guffawed. \"Don\\'t look at me that way, bastard. I know your secret. \\nYou\\'ve dreamt the same kind of dreams.\" \\n\"No,\" Jon Snow said, horrified. \"I wouldn\\'t . . .\" \\n\"No? Never?\" Tyrion raised an eyebrow. \"Well, no doubt the Starks have been terribly good to you. I\\'m \\ncertain Lady Stark treats you as if you were one of her own. And your brother Robb, he\\'s always been \\nkind, and why not? He gets Winterfell and you get the Wall. And your father . . . he must have good \\nreasons for packing you off to the Night\\'s Watch \\n\"Stop it,\" Jon Snow said, his face dark with anger. \"The Night\\'s Watch is a noble calling!\" \\nTyrion laughed. \"You\\'re too smart to believe that. The Night\\'s Watch is a midden heap for all the misfits \\nof the realm. I\\'ve seen you looking at Yoren and his boys. Those are your new brothers, Jon Snow, how \\ndo you like them? Sullen peasants, debtors, poachers, rapers, thieves, and bastards like you all wind up \\non the Wall, watching for \\ngrumkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. The good part is \\nthere are no grumkins or snarks, so it\\'s scarcely dangerous work. The bad part is you freeze your balls \\noff, but since you\\'re not allowed to breed anyway, I don\\'t suppose that matters.\" \\n\"Stop it!\" the boy screamed. He took a step forward, his hands coiling into fists, close to tears. \\nSuddenly, absurdly, Tyrion felt guilty. He took a step forward, intending to give the boy a reassuring pat \\non the shoulder or mutter some word of apology. \\nHe never saw the wolf, where it was or how it came at him. One moment he was walking toward Snow \\nand the next he was flat on his back on the hard rocky ground, the book spinning away from him as he \\nfell, the breath going out of him at the sudden impact, his mouth full of dirt and blood and rotting leaves. \\nAs he tried to get up, his back spasmed painfully. He must have wrenched it in the fall. He ground his \\nteeth in frustration, grabbed a root, and pulled himself back to a sitting position. \"Help me,\" he said to the \\nboy, reaching up a hand. \\n  81\\n\\nAnd suddenly the wolf was between them. He did not growl. The damned thing never made a sound. He \\nonly looked at him with those bright red eyes, and showed him his teeth, and that was more than enough. \\nTyrion sagged back to the ground with a grunt. \"Don\\'t help me, then. I\\'ll sit right here until you leave.\" \\nJon Snow stroked Ghost\\'s thick white fur, smiling now. \"Ask me nicely.\" \\nTyrion Lannister felt the anger coiling inside him, and crushed it out with a will. It was not the first time in \\nhis life he had been humiliated, and it would not be the last. Perhaps he even deserved this. \"I should be \\nvery grateful for your kind assistance, Jon,\" he said mildly. \\n\"Down, Ghost,\" the boy said. The direwolf sat on his haunches. Those red eyes never left Tyrion. Jon \\ncame around behind him, slid his hands under his arms, and lifted him easily to his feet. Then he picked \\nup the book and handed it back. \\n\"Why did he attack me\\'?\" Tyrion asked with a sidelong glance at the direwolf. He wiped blood and dirt \\nfrom his mouth with the back of his hand. \\n\"Maybe he thought you were a grumkin.\" \\nTyrion glanced at him sharply. Then he laughed, a raw snort of amusement that came bursting out \\nthrough his nose entirely without his permission. \"Oh, gods,\" he said, choking on his laughter and shaking \\nhis head, \"I suppose I do rather look like a grumkin. What does he do to snarks?\" \\n\"You don\\'t want to know.\" Jon picked up the wineskin and handed it to Tyrion. \\nTyrion pulled out the stopper, tilted his head, and squeezed a long stream into his mouth. The wine was \\ncool fire as it trickled down his throat and warmed his belly. He held out the skin to Jon Snow. \"Want \\nsome?\" \\nThe boy took the skin and tried a cautious swallow. \"It\\'s true, isn\\'t it?\" he said when he was done. \"What \\nyou said about the Night\\'s Watch.\" \\nTyrion nodded. \\nJon Snow set his mouth in a grim line. \"If that\\'s what it is, that\\'s what it is.\" \\nTyrion grinned at him. \"That\\'s good, bastard. Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it.\" \\n\"Most men,\" the boy said. \"But not you.\" \\n\"No,\" Tyrion admitted, \"not me. I seldom even dream of dragons anymore. There are no dragons.\" He \\nscooped up the fallen bearskin. \"Come, we had better return to camp before your uncle calls the \\nbanners.\" \\nThe walk was short, but the ground was rough underfoot and his legs were cramping badly by the time \\nthey got back. Jon Snow offered a hand to help him over a thick tangle of roots, but Tyrion shook him \\noff. He would make his own way, as he had all his life. Still, the camp was a welcome sight. The shelters \\nhad been thrown up against the tumbledown wall of a long-abandoned holdfast, a shield against the wind. \\n  82\\n\\nThe horses had been fed and a fire had been laid. Yoren sat on a stone, skinning a squirrel. The savory \\nsmell of stew filled Tyrion\\'s nostrils. He dragged himself over to where his man Morrec was tending the \\nstewpot. Wordlessly, Morrec handed him the ladle. Tyrion tasted and handed it back. \"More pepper,\" \\nhe said. \\nBenjen Stark emerged from the shelter he shared with his nephew. \"There you are. Jon, damn it, don\\'t \\ngo off like that by yourself. I thought the Others had gotten you.\" \\n\"It was the grumkins,\" Tyrion told him, laughing. Jon Snow smiled. Stark shot a baffled look at Yoren. \\nThe old man grunted, shrugged, and went back to his bloody work. \\nThe squirrel gave some body to the stew, and they ate it with black bread and hard cheese that night \\naround their fire. Tyrion shared around his skin of wine until even Yoren grew mellow. One by one the \\ncompany drifted off to their shelters and to sleep, all but Jon Snow, who had drawn the night\\'s first \\nwatch. \\nTyrion was the last to retire, as always. As he stepped into the shelter his men had built for him, he \\npaused and looked back at Jon Snow. The boy stood near the fire, his face still and hard, looking deep \\ninto the flames. \\nTyrion Lannister smiled sadly and went to bed. \\nCATELYN \\nNed and the girls were eight days gone when Maester Luwin came to her one night in Bran\\'s sickroom, \\ncarrying a reading lamp and the books of account. \"It is past time that we reviewed the figures, my lady,\" \\nhe said. \"You\\'ll want to know how much this royal visit cost us.\" \\nCatelyn looked at Bran in his sickbed and brushed his hair back off his forehead. It had grown very \\nlong, she realized. She would have to cut it soon. \"I have no need to look at figures, Maester Luwin,\" she \\ntold him, never taking her eyes from Bran. \"I know what the visit cost us. Take the books away.\" \\n\"My lady, the king\\'s party had healthy appetites. We must replenish our stores before-\" \\nShe cut him off. \"I said, take the books away. The steward will attend to our needs.\" \\n\"We have no steward,\" Maester Luwin reminded her. Like a little grey rat, she thought, he would not let \\ngo. \"Poole went south to establish Lord Eddard\\'s household at King\\'s Landing.\" \\nCatelyn nodded absently. \"Oh, yes. I remember.\" Bran looked so pale. She wondered whether they \\nmight move his bed under the window, so he could get the morning sun. \\nMaester Luwin set the lamp in a niche by the door and fiddled with its wick. \"There are several \\nappointments that require your immediate \\n  83\\n\\nattention, my lady. Besides the steward, we need a captain of the guards to fill Jory\\'s place, a new \\nmaster of horse-\" \\nHer eyes snapped around and found him. \"A master of horse?\" Her voice was a whip. \\nThe maester was shaken. \"Yes, my lady. Hullen rode south with Lord Eddard, so-\" \\n\"My son lies here broken and dying, Luwin, and you wish to discuss a new master of horse? Do you \\nthink I care what happens in the stables? Do you think it matters to me one whit? I would gladly butcher \\nevery horse in Winterfell with my own hands if it would open Bran\\'s eyes, do you understand that? Do \\nyou?\" \\nHe bowed his head. \"Yes, my lady, but the appointments-\" \\n\"I\\'ll make the appointments,\" Robb said. \\nCatelyn had not heard him enter, but there he stood in the doorway, looking at her. She had been \\nshouting, she realized with a sudden flush of shame. What was happening to her? She was so tired, and \\nher head hurt all the time. \\nMaester Luwin looked from Catelyn to her son. \"I have prepared a list of those we might wish to \\nconsider for the vacant offices,\" he said, offering Robb a paper plucked from his sleeve. \\nHer son glanced at the names. He had come from outside, Catelyn saw; his cheeks were red from the \\ncold, his hair shaggy and windblown. \"Good men,\" he said. \"We\\'ll talk about them tomorrow.\" He \\nhanded back the list of names. \\n\"Very good, my lord.\" The paper vanished into his sleeve. \\n\"Leave us now,\" Robb said. Maester Luwin bowed and departed. Robb closed the door behind him \\nand turned to her. He was wearing a sword, she saw. \"Mother, what are you doing?\" \\nCatelyn had always thought Robb looked like her; like Bran and Rickon and Sansa, he had the Tully \\ncoloring, the auburn hair, the blue eyes. Yet now for the first time she saw something of Eddard Stark in \\nhis face, something as stern and hard as the north. \"What am I doing?\" she echoed, puzzled. \"How can \\nyou ask that? What do you imagine I\\'m doing? I am taking care of your brother. I am taking care of \\nBran.\" \\n\"Is that what you call it? You haven\\'t left this room since Bran was hurt. You didn\\'t even come to the \\ngate when Father and the girls went south.\" \\n\"I said my farewells to them here, and watched them ride out from that window.\" She had begged Ned \\nnot to go, not now, not after what had happened; everything had changed now, couldn\\'t he see that? It \\nwas no use. He had no choice, he had told her, and then he left, choosing. \"I can\\'t leave him, even for a \\nmoment, not when any moment \\ncould be his last. I have to be with him, if ... if .\"She took her son\\'s limp hand, sliding his fingers \\nthrough her own. He was so frail and thin, with no strength left in his hand, but she could still feel the \\nwarmth of life through his skin. \\n  84\\n\\nRobb\\'s voice softened. \"He\\'s not going to die, Mother. Maester Luwin says the time of greatest danger \\nhas passed.\" \\n\"And what if Maester Luwin is wrong? What if Bran needs me and I\\'m not here?\" \\n\"Rickon needs you,\" Robb said sharply. \"He\\'s only three, he doesn\\'t understand what\\'s happening. He \\nthinks everyone has deserted him, so he follows me around all day, clutching my leg and crying. I don\\'t \\nknow what to do with him.\" He paused a moment, chewing on his lower lip the way he\\'d done when he \\nwas little. \"Mother, I need you too. I\\'m trying but I can\\'t . . . I can\\'t do it all by myself.\" His voice broke \\nwith sudden emotion, and Catelyn remembered that he was only fourteen. She wanted to get up and go \\nto him, but Bran was still holding her hand and she could not move. \\nOutside the tower, a wolf began to howl. Catelyn trembled, just for a second. \\n\"Bran\\'s.\" Robb opened the window and let the night air into the stuffy tower room. The howling grew \\nlouder. It was a cold and lonely sound, full of melancholy and despair. \\n\"Don\\'t,\" she told him. \"Bran needs to stay warm.\" \\n\"He needs to hear them sing,\" Robb said. Somewhere out in Winterfell, a second wolf began to howl in \\nchorus with the first. Then a third, closer. \"Shaggydog and Grey Wind,\" Robb said as their voices rose \\nand fell together. \"You can tell them apart if you listen close.\" \\nCatelyn was shaking. It was the grief, the cold, the howling of the direwolves. Night after night, the \\nhowling and the cold wind and the grey empty castle, on and on they went, never changing, and her boy \\nlying there broken, the sweetest of her children, the gentlest, Bran who loved to laugh and climb and \\ndreamt of knighthood, all gone now, she would never hear him laugh again. Sobbing, she pulled her hand \\nfree of his and covered her ears against those terrible howls. \"Make them stop!\" she cried. \"I can\\'t stand \\nit, make them stop, make them stop, kill them all if you must, just make them stop!\" \\nShe didn\\'t remember falling to the floor, but there she was, and Robb was lifting her, holding her in \\nstrong arms. \"Don\\'t be afraid, Mother. They would never hurt him.\" He helped her to her narrow bed in \\nthe corner of the sickroom. \"Close your eyes,\" he said gently. \"Rest. Maester Luwin tells me you\\'ve \\nhardly slept since Bran\\'s fall.\" \\n\"I can\\'t,\" she wept. \"Gods forgive me, Robb, I can\\'t, what if he dies \\nwhile I\\'m asleep, what if he dies, what if he dies . . .\" The wolves were still howling. She screamed and \\nheld her ears again. \"Oh, gods, close the window!\" \\n\"If you swear to me you\\'ll sleep.\" Robb went to the window, but as he reached for the shutters another \\nsound was added to the mournful howling of the direwolves. \"Dogs,\" he said, listening. \"All the dogs are \\nbarking. They\\'ve never done that before . . .\" Catelyn heard his breath catch in his throat. When she \\nlooked up, his face was pale in the lamplight. \"Fire, \" he whispered. \\nFire, she thought, and then, Bran! \"Help me,\" she said urgently, sitting up. \"Help me with Bran.\" \\nRobb did not seem to hear her. \"The library tower\\'s on fire,\" he said. \\n  85\\n\\nCatelyn could see the flickering reddish light through the open window now. She sagged with relief. Bran \\nwas safe. The library was across the bailey, there was no way the fire would reach them here. \"Thank the \\ngods,\" she whispered. \\nRobb looked at her as if she\\'d gone mad. \"Mother, stay here. I\\'ll come back as soon as the fire\\'s out.\" \\nHe ran then. She heard him shout to the guards outside the room, heard them descending together in a \\nwild rush, taking the stairs two and three at a time. \\nOutside, there were shouts of \"Fire!\" in the yard, screams, running footsteps, the whinny of frightened \\nhorses, and the frantic barking of the castle dogs. The howling was gone, she realized as she listened to \\nthe cacophony. The direwolves had fallen silent. \\nCatelyn said a silent prayer of thanks to the seven faces of god as she went to the window. Across the \\nbailey, long tongues of flame shot from the windows of the library. She watched the smoke rise into the \\nsky and thought sadly of all the books the Starks had gathered over the centuries. Then she closed the \\nshutters. \\nWhen she turned away from the window, the man was in the room with her. \\n\"You weren\\'t s\\'posed to be here,\" he muttered sourly. \"No one was s\\'posed to be here.\" \\nHe was a small, dirty man in filthy brown clothing, and he stank of horses. Catelyn knew all the men who \\nworked in their stables, and he was none of them. He was gaunt, with limp blond hair and pale eyes \\ndeep-sunk in a bony face, and there was a dagger in his hand. \\nCatelyn looked at the knife, then at Bran. \"No,\" she said. The word stuck in her throat, the merest \\nwhisper. \\nHe must have heard her. \"It\\'s a mercy,\" he said. \"He\\'s dead already.\" \\n\"No,\" Catelyn said, louder now as she found her voice again. \"No, you can\\'t.\" She spun back toward the \\nwindow to scream for help, but the man moved faster than she would have believed. One hand clamped \\ndown over her mouth and yanked back her head, the other brought the dagger up to her windpipe. The \\nstench of him was overwhelming. \\nShe reached up with both hands and grabbed the blade with all her strength, pulling it away from her \\nthroat. She heard him cursing into her ear. Her fingers were slippery with blood, but she would not let go \\nof the dagger. The hand over her mouth clenched more tightly, shutting off her air. Catelyn twisted her \\nhead to the side and managed to get a piece of his flesh between her teeth. She bit down hard into his \\npalm. The man grunted in pain. She ground her teeth together and tore at him, and all of a sudden he let \\ngo. The taste of his blood filled her mouth. She sucked in air and screamed, and he grabbed her hair and \\npulled her away from him, and she stumbled and went down, and then he was standing over her, \\nbreathing hard, shaking. The dagger was still clutched tightly in his right hand, slick with blood. \"You \\nweren\\'t s\\'posed to be here,\" he repeated stupidly. \\nCatelyn saw the shadow slip through the open door behind him. There was a low rumble, less than a \\nsnarl, the merest whisper of a threat, but he must have heard something, because he started to turn just as \\nthe wolf made its leap. They went down together, half sprawled over Catelyn where she\\'d fallen. The \\n  86\\n\\nwolf had him under the jaw. The man\\'s shriek lasted less than a second before the beast wrenched back \\nits head, taking out half his throat. \\nHis blood felt like warm rain as it sprayed across her face. \\nThe wolf was looking at her. Its jaws were red and wet and its eyes glowed golden in the dark room. It \\nwas Bran\\'s wolf, she realized. Of course it was. \"Thank you,\" Catelyn whispered, her voice faint and tiny. \\nShe lifted her hand, trembling. The wolf padded closer, sniffed at her fingers, then licked at the blood \\nwith a wet rough tongue. When it had cleaned all the blood off her hand, it turned away silently and \\njumped up on Bran\\'s bed and lay down beside him. Catelyn began to laugh hysterically. \\nThat was the way they found them, when Robb and Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik burst in with half the \\nguards in Winterfell. When the laughter finally died in her throat, they wrapped her in warm blankets and \\nled her back to the Great Keep, to her own chambers. Old Nan undressed her and helped her into a \\nscalding hot bath and washed the blood off her with a soft cloth. \\nAfterward Maester Luwin arrived to dress her wounds. The cuts in \\nA CAME OF THRONES 119 \\nher fingers went deep, almost to the bone, and her scalp was raw and bleeding where he\\'d pulled out a \\nhandful of hair. The maester told her the pain was just starting now, and gave her milk of the poppy to \\nhelp her sleep. \\nFinally she closed her eyes. \\nWhen she opened them again, they told her that she had slept four days. Catelyn nodded and sat up in \\nbed. It all seemed like a nightmare to her now, everything since Bran\\'s fall, a terrible dream of blood and \\ngrief, but she had the pain in her hands to remind her that it was real. She felt weak and light-headed, yet \\nstrangely resolute, as if a great weight had lifted from her. \\n\"Bring me some bread and honey,\" she told her servants, \"and take word to Maester Luwin that my \\nbandages want changing.\" They looked at her in surprise and ran to do her bidding. \\nCatelyn remembered the way she had been before, and she was ashamed. She had let them all down, \\nher children, her husband, her House. It would not happen again. She would show these northerners how \\nstrong a Tully of Riverrun could be. \\nRobb arrived before her food. Rodrik Cassel came with him, and her husband\\'s ward Theon Greyjoy, \\nand lastly Hallis Mollen, a muscular guardsman with a square brown beard. He was the new captain of \\nthe guard, Robb said. Her son was dressed in boiled leather and ringmail, she saw, and a sword hung at \\nhis waist. \\n\"Who was he?\" Catelyn asked them. \\n\"No one knows his name,\" Hallis Mollen told her. \"He was no man of Winterfell, m\\'lady, but some says \\nthey seen him here and about the castle these past few weeks.\" \\n\"One of the king\\'s men, then,\" she said, \"or one of the Lannisters\\'. He could have waited behind when \\nthe others left.\" \\n  87\\n\\n\"Maybe,\" Hal said. \"With all these strangers filling up Winterfell of late, there\\'s no way of saying who he \\nbelonged to.\" \\n\"He\\'d been biding in your stables,\" Greyjoy said. \"You could smell it on him.\" \\n\"And how could he go unnoticed?\" she said sharply. \\nHallis Mollen looked abashed. \"Between the horses Lord Eddard took south and them we sent north to \\nthe Night\\'s Watch, the stalls were half-empty. It were no great trick to hide from the stableboys. Could \\nbe Hodor saw him, the talk is that boy\\'s been acting queer, but simple as he is . . .\" Hal shook his head. \\n\"We found where he\\'d been sleeping,\" Robb put in. \"He had ninety silver stags in a leather bag buried \\nbeneath the straw.\" \\n\"It\\'s good to know my son\\'s life was not sold cheaply,\" Catelyn said bitterly. \\nHallis Mollen looked at her, confused. \"Begging your grace, m\\'lady, you saying he was out to kill your \\nboy?\" \\nGreyjoy was doubtful. \"That\\'s madness.\" \\n\"He came for Bran,\" Catelyn said. \"He kept muttering how I wasn\\'t supposed to be there. He set the \\nlibrary fire thinking I would rush to put it out, taking any guards with me. If I hadn\\'t been half-mad with \\ngrief, it would have worked.\" \\n\"Why would anyone want to kill Bran?\" Robb said. \"Gods, he\\'s only a little boy, helpless, sleeping . . .\" \\nCatelyn gave her firstborn a challenging look. \"If you are to rule in the north, you must think these things \\nthrough, Robb. Answer your own question. Why would anyone want to kill a sleeping child?\" \\nBefore he could answer, the servants returned with a plate of food fresh from the kitchen. There was \\nmuch more than she\\'d asked for: hot bread, butter and honey and blackberry preserves, a rasher of \\nbacon and a soft-boiled egg, a wedge of cheese, a pot of mint tea. And with it came Maester Luwin. \\n\"How is my son, Maester?\" Catelyn looked at all the food and found she had no appetite. \\nMaester Luwin lowered his eyes. \"Unchanged, my lady.\" \\nIt was the reply she had expected, no more and no less. Her hands throbbed with pain, as if the blade \\nwere still in her, cutting deep. She sent the servants away and looked back to Robb. \"Do you have the \\nanswer yet?\" \\n\"Someone is afraid Bran might wake up,\" Robb said, \"afraid of what he might say or do, afraid of \\nsomething he knows.\" \\nCatelyn was proud of him. \"Very good.\" She turned to the new captain of the guard. \"We must keep \\nBran safe. If there was one killer, there could be others.\" \\n\"How many guards do you want, rn\\'lady?\" Hal asked. \\n  88\\n\\n\"So long as Lord Eddard is away, my son is the master of Winterfell,\" she told him. \\nRobb stood a little taller. \"Put one man in the sickroom, night and day, one outside the door, two at the \\nbottom of the stairs. No one sees Bran without my warrant or my mother\\'s.\" \\n\"As you say, m\\'lord.\" \\n\"Do it now,\" Catelyn suggested. \\n\"And let his wolf stay in the room with him,\" Robb added. \\n\"Yes,\" Catelyn said. And then again: \"Yes.\" \\nHallis Mollen bowed and left the room. \\n\"Lady Stark,\" Ser Rodrik said when the guardsman had gone, \"did you chance to notice the dagger the \\nkiller used?\" \\n\"The circumstances did not allow me to examine it closely, but I can vouch for its edge,\" Catelyn replied \\nwith a dry smile. \"Why do you ask?\" \\n\"We found the knife still in the villain\\'s grasp. It seemed to me that it was altogether too fine a weapon \\nfor such a man, so I looked at it long and hard. The blade is Valyrian steel, the hilt dragonbone. A \\nweapon like that has no business being in the hands of such as him. Someone gave it to him.\" \\nCatelyn nodded, thoughtful. \"Robb, close the door.\" \\nHe looked at her strangely, but did as she told him. \\n\"What I am about to tell you must not leave this room,\" she told them. \"I want your oaths on that. If even \\npart of what I suspect is true, Ned and my girls have ridden into deadly danger, and a word in the wrong \\nears could mean their lives.\" \\n\"Lord Eddard is a second father to me,\" said Theon Greyjoy. \"I do so swear.\" \\n\"You have my oath,\" Maester Luwin said. \\n\"And mine, my lady,\" echoed Ser Rodrik. \\nShe looked at her son. \"And you, Robb?\" \\nHe nodded his consent. \\n\"My sister Lysa believes the Lannisters murdered her husband, Lord Arryn, the Hand of the King,\" \\nCatelyn told them. \"It comes to me that Jaime Lannister did not join the hunt the day Bran fell. He \\nremained here in the castle.\" The room was deathly quiet. \"I do not think Bran fell from that tower,\" she \\nsaid into the stillness. \"I think he was thrown.\" \\n  89\\n\\nThe shock was plain on their faces. \"My lady, that is a monstrous suggestion,\" said Rodrik Cassel. \"Even \\nthe Kingslayer would flinch at the murder of an innocent child.\" \\n\"Oh, would he?\" Theon Greyjoy asked. \"I wonder.\" \\n\"There is no limit to Lannister pride or Lannister ambition,\" Catelyn said. \\n\"The boy had always been surehanded in the past,\" Maester Luwin said thoughtfully. \"He knew every \\nstone in Winterfell.\" \\n\"Gods, \" Robb swore, his young face dark with anger. \"If this is true, he will pay for it.\" He drew his \\nsword and waved it in the air. \"I\\'ll kill him myself!\" \\nSer Rodrik bristled at him. \"Put that away! The Lannisters are a hundred leagues away. Never draw \\nyour sword unless you mean to use it. How many times must I tell you, foolish boy?\" \\n122 GLORGL R.R. MARTIN \\nAbashed, Robb sheathed his sword, suddenly a child again. Catelyn said to Ser Rodrik, \"I see my son is \\nwearing steel now.\" \\nThe old master-at-arms said, \"I thought it was time.\" \\nRobb was looking at her anxiously. \"Past time,\" she said. \"Winterfell may have need of all its swords \\nsoon, and they had best not be made of wood.\" \\nTheon Greyjoy put a hand on the hilt of his blade and said, \"My lady, if it comes to that, my House owes \\nyours a great debt.\" \\nMaester Luwin pulled at his chain collar where it chafed against his neck. \"All we have is conjecture. \\nThis is the queen\\'s beloved brother we mean to accuse. She will not take it kindly. We must have proof, \\nor forever keep silent.\" \\n\"Your proof is in the dagger,\" Ser Rodrik said. \"A fine blade like that will not have gone unnoticed.\" \\nThere was only one place to find the truth of it, Catelyn realized. \"Someone must go to King\\'s Landing.\" \\n\"I\\'ll go,\" Robb said. \\n\"No,\" she told him. \"Your place is here. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.\" She looked at Ser \\nRodrik with his great white whiskers, at Maester Luwin in his grey robes, at young Greyjoy, lean and \\ndark and impetuous. Who to send? Who would be believed? Then she knew. Catelyn struggled to push \\nback the blankets, her bandaged fingers as stiff and unyielding as stone. She climbed out of bed. \"I must \\ngo myself.\" \\n\"My lady,\" said Maester Luwin, \"is that wise? Surely the Lannisters would greet your arrival with \\nsuspicion.\" \\n\"What about Bran?\" Robb asked. The poor boy looked utterly confused now. \"You can\\'t mean to leave \\nhim.\" \\n  90\\n\\n\"I have done everything I can for Bran,\" she said, laying a wounded hand on his arm. \"His life is in the \\nhands of the gods and Maester Luwin. As you reminded me yourself, Robb, I have other children to \\nthink of now.\" \\n\"You will need a strong escort, my lady,\" Theon said. \\n\"I\\'ll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen,\" Robb said. \\n\"No,\" Catelyn said. \"A large party attracts unwelcome attention. I would not have the Lannisters know I \\nam coming.\" \\nSer Rodrik protested. \"My lady, let me accompany you at least. The kingsroad can be perilous for a \\nwoman alone.\" \\n\"I will not be taking the kingsroad,\" Catelyn replied. She thought for a moment, then nodded her \\nconsent. \"Two riders can move as fast as one, and a good deal faster than a long column burdened by \\nwagons \\nand wheelhouses. I will welcome your company, Ser Rodrik. We will follow the White Knife down to \\nthe sea, and hire a ship at White Harbor. Strong horses and brisk winds should bring us to King\\'s \\nLanding well ahead of Ned and the Lannisters.\" And then, she thought, we shall see what we shall see. \\nSANSA \\nEddard Stark had left before dawn, Septa Mordane informed Sansa as they broke their fast. \"The king \\nsent for him. Another hunt, I do believe. There are still wild aurochs in these lands, I am told.\" \\n\"I\\'ve never seen an aurochs,\" Sansa said, feeding a piece of bacon to Lady under the table. The direwolf \\ntook it from her hand, as delicate as a queen. \\nSepta Mordane sniffed in disapproval. \"A noble lady does not feed dogs at her table,\" she said, breaking \\noff another piece of comb and letting the honey drip down onto her bread. \\n\"She\\'s not a dog, she\\'s a direwolf,\" Sansa pointed out as Lady licked her fingers with a rough tongue. \\n\"Anyway, Father said we could keep them with us if we want.\" \\nThe septa was not appeased. \"You\\'re a good girl, Sansa, but I do vow, when it comes to that creature \\nyou\\'re as willful as your sister Arya.\" She scowled. \"And where is Arya this morning?\" \\n\"She wasn\\'t hungry,\" Sansa said, knowing full well that her sister had probably stolen down to the \\nkitchen hours ago and wheedled a breakfast out of some cook\\'s boy. \\n\"Do remind her to dress nicely today. The grey velvet, perhaps. We are all invited to ride with the queen \\nand Princess Myrcella in the royal wheelhouse, and we must look our best.\" \\n  91\\n\\nSansa already looked her best. She had brushed out her long auburn hair until it shone, and picked her \\nnicest blue silks. She had been looking forward to today for more than a week. It was a great honor to \\nride with the queen, and besides, Prince Joffrey might be there. Her betrothed. Just thinking it made her \\nfeel a strange fluttering inside, even though they were not to marry for years and years. Sansa did not \\nreally know Joffrey yet, but she was already in love with him. He was all she ever dreamt her prince \\nshould be, tall and handsome and strong, with hair like gold. She treasured every chance to spend time \\nwith him, few as they were. The only thing that scared her about today was Arya. Arya had a way of \\nruining everything. You never knew what she would do. \"I\\'ll tell her,\" Sansa said uncertainly, \"but she\\'ll \\ndress the way she always does.\" She hoped it wouldn\\'t be too embarrassing. \"May I be excused?\" \\n\"You may.\" Septa Mordane helped herself to more bread and honey, and Sansa slid from the bench. \\nLady followed at her heels as she ran from the inn\\'s common room. \\nOutside, she stood for a moment amidst the shouts and curses and the creak of wooden wheels as the \\nmen broke down the tents and pavilions and loaded the wagons for another day\\'s march. The inn was a \\nsprawling three-story structure of pale stone, the biggest that Sansa had ever seen, but even so, it had \\naccommodations for less than a third of the king\\'s party, which had swollen to more than four hundred \\nwith the addition of her father\\'s household and the freeriders who had joined them on the road. \\nShe found Arya on the banks of the Trident, trying to hold Nymeria still while she brushed dried mud \\nfrom her fur. The direwolf was not enjoying the process. Arya was wearing the same riding leathers she \\nhad worn yesterday and the day before. \\n\"You better put on something pretty,\" Sansa told her. \"Septa Mordane said so. We\\'re traveling in the \\nqueen\\'s wheelhouse with Princess Myrcella today.\" \\n\"I\\'m not,\" Arya said, trying to brush a tangle out of Nymeria\\'s matted grey fur. \"Mycah and I are going to \\nride upstream and look for rubies at the ford.\" \\n\"Rubies,\" Sansa said, lost. \"What rubies?\" \\nArya gave her a look like she was so stupid. \"Rhaegar\\'s rubies. This is where King Robert killed him and \\nwon the crown.\" \\nSansa regarded her scrawny little sister in disbelief. \"You can\\'t look for rubies, the princess is expecting \\nus. The queen invited us both.\" \\n\"I don\\'t care,\" Arya said. \"The wheelhouse doesn\\'t even have windows, you can\\'t see a thing.\" \\n\"What could you want to see?\" Sansa said, annoyed. She had been thrilled by the invitation, and her \\nstupid sister was going to ruin everything, just as she\\'d feared. \"It\\'s all just fields and farms and holdfasts.\" \\n\"It is not,\" Arya said stubbornly. \"If you came with us sometimes, you\\'d see.\" \\n\"I hate riding,\" Sansa said fervently. \"All it does is get you soiled and dusty and sore.\" \\nArya shrugged. \"Hold still, \" she snapped at Nymeria, \"I\\'m not hurting you.\" Then to Sansa she said, \\n\"When we were crossing the Neck, I counted thirty-six flowers I never saw before, and Mycah showed \\nme a lizard-lion.\" \\n  92\\n\\nSansa shuddered. They had been twelve days crossing the Neck, rumbling down a crooked causeway \\nthrough an endless black bog, and she had hated every moment of it. The air had been damp and \\nclammy, the causeway so narrow they could not even make proper camp at night, they had to stop right \\non the kingsroad. Dense thickets of halfdrowned trees pressed close around them, branches dripping \\nwith curtains of pale fungus. Huge flowers bloomed in the mud and floated on pools of stagnant water, \\nbut if you were stupid enough to leave the causeway to pluck them, there were quicksands waiting to \\nsuck you down, and snakes watching from the trees, and lizard-lions floating half-submerged in the \\nwater, like black logs with eyes and teeth. \\nNone of which stopped Arya, of course. One day she came back grinning her horsey grin, her hair all \\ntangled and her clothes covered in mud, clutching a raggedy bunch of purple and green flowers for \\nFather. Sansa kept hoping he would tell Arya to behave herself and act like the highborn lady she was \\nsupposed to be, but he never did, he only hugged her and thanked her for the flowers. That just made her \\nworse. \\nThen it turned out the purple flowers were called poison kisses, and Arya got a rash on her arms. Sansa \\nwould have thought that might have taught her a lesson, but Arya laughed about it, and the next day she \\nrubbed mud all over her arms like some ignorant bog woman just because her friend Mycah told her it \\nwould stop the itching. She had bruises on her arms and shoulders too, dark purple welts and faded \\ngreen-and-yellow splotches, Sansa had seen them when her sister undressed for sleep. How she had \\ngotten those only the seven gods knew. \\nArya was still going on, brushing out Nymeria\\'s tangles and chattering about things she\\'d seen on the trek \\nsouth. \"Last week we found this haunted watchtower, and the day before we chased a herd of wild \\nhorses. You should have seen them run when they caught a scent of \\nNymeria.\" The wolf wriggled in her grasp and Arya scolded her. \"Stop that, I have to do the other side, \\nyou\\'re all muddy.\" \\n\"You\\'re not supposed to leave the column,\" Sansa reminded her. \"Father said so.\" \\nArya shrugged. \"I didn\\'t go far. Anyway, Nymeria was with me the whole time. I don\\'t always go off, \\neither. Sometimes it\\'s fun just to ride along with the wagons and talk to people.\" \\nSansa knew all about the sorts of people Arya liked to talk to: squires and grooms and serving girls, old \\nmen and naked children, rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth. Arya would make friends with \\nanybody. This Mycah was the worst; a butcher\\'s boy, thirteen and wild, he slept in the meat wagon and \\nsmelled of the slaughtering block. Just the sight of him was enough to make Sansa feel sick, but Arya \\nseemed to prefer his company to hers. \\nSansa was running out of patience now. \"You have to come with me,\" she told her sister firmly. \"You \\ncan\\'t refuse the queen. Septa Mordane will expect you.\" \\nArya ignored her. She gave a hard yank with the brush. Nymeria growled and spun away, affronted. \\n\"Come back here!\" \\n\"There\\'s going to be lemon cakes and tea,\" Sansa went on, all adult and reasonable. Lady brushed \\nagainst her leg. Sansa scratched her ears the way she liked, and Lady sat beside her on her haunches, \\n  93\\n\\nwatching Arya chase Nymeria. \"Why would you want to ride a smelly old horse and get all sore and \\nsweaty when you could recline on feather pillows and eat cakes with the queen?\" \\n\"I don\\'t like the queen,\" Arya said casually. Sansa sucked in her breath, shocked that even Arya would \\nsay such a thing, but her sister prattled on, heedless. \"She won\\'t even let me bring Nymeria.\" She thrust \\nthe brush under her belt and stalked her wolf. Nymeria watched her approach warily. \\n\"A royal wheelhouse is no place for a wolf,\" Sansa said. \"And Princess Myrcella is afraid of them, you \\nknow that.\" \\n\"Myrcella is a little baby.\" Arya grabbed Nymeria around her neck, but the moment she pulled out the \\nbrush again the direwolf wriggled free and bounded off. Frustrated, Arya threw down the brush. \"Bad \\nwolf!\" she shouted. \\nSansa couldn\\'t help but smile a little. The kennelmaster once told her that an animal takes after its master. \\nShe gave Lady a quick little hug. Lady licked her cheek. Sansa giggled. Arya heard and whirled around, \\nglaring. \"I don\\'t care what you say, I\\'m going out riding.\" Her long horsey face got the stubborn look that \\nmeant she was going to do something willful. \\n\"Gods be true, Arya, sometimes you act like such a child,\" Sansa said. \"I\\'ll go by myself then. It will be \\never so much nicer that way. Lady and I will eat all the lemon cakes and just have the best time without \\nyou.\" \\nShe turned to walk off, but Arya shouted after her, \"They won\\'t let you bring Lady either.\" She was gone \\nbefore Sansa could think of a reply, chasing Nymeria along the river. \\nAlone and humiliated, Sansa took the long way back to the inn, where she knew Septa Mordane would \\nbe waiting. Lady padded quietly by her side. She was almost in tears. All she wanted was for things to be \\nnice and pretty, the way they were in the songs. Why couldn\\'t Arya be sweet and delicate and kind, like \\nPrincess Myrcella? She would have liked a sister like that. \\nSansa could never understand how two sisters, born only two years apart, could be so different. It \\nwould have been easier if Arya had been a bastard, like their half brother Jon. She even looked like Jon, \\nwith the long face and brown hair of the Starks, and nothing of their lady mother in her face or her \\ncoloring. And Jon\\'s mother had been common, or so people whispered. Once, when she was littler, \\nSansa had even asked Mother if perhaps there hadn\\'t been some mistake. Perhaps the grumkins had \\nstolen her real sister. But Mother had only laughed and said no, Arya was her daughter and Sansa\\'s \\ntrueborn sister, blood of their blood. Sansa could not think why Mother would want to lie about it, so she \\nsupposed it had to be true. \\nAs she neared the center of camp, her distress was quickly forgotten. A crowd had gathered around the \\nqueen\\'s wheelhouse. Sansa heard excited voices buzzing like a hive of bees. The doors had been thrown \\nopen, she saw, and the queen stood at the top of the wooden steps, smiling down at someone. She heard \\nher saying, \"The council does us great honor, my good lords.\" \\n\"What\\'s happening?\" she asked a squire she knew. \\n\"The council sent riders from King\\'s Landing to escort us the rest of the way,\" he told her. \"An honor \\nguard for the king.\" \\n  94\\n\\nAnxious to see, Sansa let Lady clear a path through the crowd. People moved aside hastily for the \\ndirewolf. When she got closer, she saw two knights kneeling before the queen, in armor so fine and \\ngorgeous that it made her blink. \\nOne knight wore an intricate suit of white enameled scales, brilliant as a field of new-fallen snow, with \\nsilver chasings and clasps that glittered in the sun. When he removed his helm, Sansa saw that he was an \\nold man with hair as pale as his armor, yet he seemed strong and \\ngraceful for all that. From his shoulders hung the pure white cloak of the Kingsguard. \\nHis companion was a man near twenty whose armor was steel plate of a deep forest-green. He was the \\nhandsomest man Sansa had ever set eyes upon; tall and powerfully made, with jet-black hair that fell to \\nhis shoulders and framed a clean-shaven face, and laughing green eyes to match his armor. Cradled \\nunder one arm was an antlered helm, its magnificent rack shimmering in gold. \\nAt first Sansa did not notice the third stranger. He did not kneel with the others. He stood to one side, \\nbeside their horses, a gaunt grim man who watched the proceedings in silence. His face was pockmarked \\nand beardless, with deepset eyes and hollow cheeks. Though he was not an old man, only a few wisps of \\nhair remained to him, sprouting above his ears, but those he had grown long as a woman\\'s. His armor \\nwas iron-grey chainmail over layers of boiled leather, plain and unadorned, and it spoke of age and hard \\nuse. Above his right shoulder the stained leather hilt of the blade strapped to his back was visible; a \\ntwo-handed greatsword, too long to be worn at his side. \\n\"The king is gone hunting, but I know he will be pleased to see you when he returns,\" the queen was \\nsaying to the two knights who knelt before her, but Sansa could not take her eyes off the third man. He \\nseemed to feel the weight of her gaze. Slowly he turned his head. Lady growled. A terror as \\noverwhelming as anything Sansa Stark had ever felt filled her suddenly. She stepped backward and \\nbumped into someone. \\nStrong hands grasped her by the shoulders, and for a moment Sansa thought it was her father, but when \\nshe turned, it was the burned face of Sandor Clegane looking down at her, his mouth twisted in a terrible \\nmockery of a smile. \"You are shaking, girl,\" he said, his voice rasping. \"Do I frighten you so much?\" \\nHe did, and had since she had first laid eyes on the ruin that fire had made of his face, though it seemed \\nto her now that he was not half so terrifying as the other. Still, Sansa wrenched away from him, and the \\nHound laughed, and Lady moved between them, rumbling a warning. Sansa dropped to her knees to \\nwrap her arms around the wolf. They were all gathered around gaping, she could feel their eyes on her, \\nand here and there she heard muttered comments and titters of laughter. \\n\"A wolf,\" a man said, and someone else said, \"Seven hells, that\\'s a direwolf,\" and the first man said, \\n\"What\\'s it doing in camp?\" and the Hound\\'s rasping voice replied, \"The Starks use them for wet nurses,\" \\nand Sansa realized that the two stranger knights were looking down on \\nher and Lady, swords in their hands, and then she was frightened again, and ashamed. Tears filled her \\neyes. \\n  95\\n\\nShe heard the queen say, \"Joffrey, go to her.\" \\nAnd her prince was there. \\n\"Leave her alone,\" Joffrey said. He stood over her, beautiful in blue wool and black leather, his golden \\ncurls shining in the sun like a crown. He gave her his hand, drew her to her feet. \"What is it, sweet lady? \\nWhy are you afraid? No one will hurt you. Put away your swords, all of you. The wolf is her little pet, \\nthat\\'s all.\" He looked at Sandor Clegane. \"And you, dog, away with you, you\\'re scaring my betrothed.\" \\nThe Hound, ever faithful, bowed and slid away quietly through the press. Sansa struggled to steady \\nherself. She felt like such a fool. She was a Stark of Winterfell, a noble lady, and someday she would be \\na queen. \"It was not him, my sweet prince,\" she tried to explain. \"It was the other one.\" \\nThe two stranger knights exchanged a look. \"Payne?\" chuckled the young man in the green armor. \\nThe older man in white spoke to Sansa gently. \"Ofttimes Ser Ilyn frightens me as well, sweet lady. He \\nhas a fearsome aspect.\" \\n\"As well he should.\" The queen had descended from the wheelhouse. The spectators parted to make \\nway for her. \"If the wicked do not fear the Mng\\'s Justice, you have put the wrong man in the office.\" \\nSansa finally found her words. \"Then surely you have chosen the right one, Your Grace,\" she said, and a \\ngale of laughter erupted all around her. \\n\"Well spoken, child,\" said the old man in white. \"As befits the daughter of Eddard Stark. I am honored \\nto know you, however irregular the manner of our meeting. I am Ser Barristan Selmy, of the \\nKingsguard.\" He bowed. \\nSansa knew the name, and now the courtesies that Septa Mordane had taught her over the years came \\nback to her. \"The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard,\" she said, \"and councillor to Robert our king and \\nto Aerys Targaryen before him. The honor is mine, good knight. Even in the far north, the singers praise \\nthe deeds of Barristan the Bold.\" \\nThe green knight laughed again. \"Barristan the Old, you mean. Don\\'t flatter him too sweetly, child, he \\nthinks overmuch of himself already.\" He smiled at her. \"Now, wolf girl, if you can put a name to me as \\nwell, then I must concede that you are truly our Hand\\'s daughter.\" \\nJoffrey stiffened beside her. \"Have a care how you address my betrothed.\" \\ncan answer,\" Sansa said quickly, to quell her prince\\'s anger. She smiled at the green knight. \"Your \\nhelmet bears golden antlers, my lord. The stag is the sigil of the royal House. King Robert has two \\nbrothers. By your extreme youth, you can only be Renly Baratheon, Lord of Storm\\'s End and councillor \\nto the king, and so I name you.\" \\nSer Barristan chuckled. \"By his extreme youth, he can only be a prancing jackanapes, and so I name \\nhim.\" \\nThere was general laughter, led by Lord Renly himself. The tension of a few moments ago was gone, \\nand Sansa was beginning to feel comfortable . . . until Ser Ilyn Payne shouldered two men aside, and \\n  96\\n\\nstood before her, unsmiling. He did not say a word. Lady bared her teeth and began to growl, a low \\nrumble full of menace, but this time Sansa silenced the wolf with a gentle hand to the head. \"I am sorry if I \\noffended you, Ser Ilyn,\" she said. \\nShe waited for an answer, but none came. As the headsman looked at her, his pale colorless eyes \\nseemed to strip the clothes away from her, and then the skin, leaving her soul naked before him. Still \\nsilent, he turned and walked away. \\nSansa did not understand. She looked at her prince. \"Did I say something wrong, Your Grace? Why will \\nhe not speak to me?\" \\n\"Ser Ilyn has not been feeling talkative these past fourteen years,\" Lord Renly commented with a sly \\nsmile. \\nJoffrey gave his uncle a look of pure loathing, then took Sansa\\'s hands in his own. \"Aerys Targaryen had \\nhis tongue ripped out with hot pincers.\" \\n\"He speaks most eloquently with his sword, however,\" the queen said, \"and his devotion to our realm is \\nunquestioned.\" Then she smiled graciously and said, \"Sansa, the good councillors and I must speak \\ntogether until the king returns with your father. I fear we shall have to postpone your day with Myrcella. \\nPlease give your sweet sister my apologies. Joffrey, perhaps you would be so kind as to entertain our \\nguest today.\" \\n\"It would be my pleasure, Mother,\" Joffrey said very formally. He took her by the arm and led her away \\nfrom the wheelhouse, and Sansa\\'s spirits took flight. A whole day with her prince! She gazed at Joffrey \\nworshipfully. He was so gallant, she thought. The way he had rescued her from Ser Ilyn and the Hound, \\nwhy, it was almost like the songs, like the time Serwyn of the Mirror Shield saved the Princess Daeryssa \\nfrom the giants, or Prince Aemon the Dragonknight championing Queen Naerys\\'s honor against evil Ser \\nMorgil\\'s slanders. \\nThe touch of Joffrey\\'s hand on her sleeve made her heart beat faster. \"What would you like to do?\" \\nBe with you, Sansa thought, but she said, \"Whatever you\\'d like to do, my prince.\" \\nJofftey reflected a moment. \"We could go riding.\" \\n\"Oh, I love riding,\" Sansa said. \\nJoffrey glanced back at Lady, who was following at their heels. \"Your wolf is liable to frighten the \\nhorses, and my dog seems to frighten you. Let us leave them both behind and set off on our own, what \\ndo you say?\" \\nSansa hesitated. \"If you like,\" she said uncertainly. \"I suppose I could tie Lady up.\" She did not quite \\nunderstand, though. \"I didn\\'t know you had a dog . . .\" \\nJoffrey laughed. \"He\\'s my mother\\'s dog, in truth. She has set him to guard me, and so he does.\" \\n\"You mean the Hound,\" she said. She wanted to hit herself for being so slow. Her prince would never \\nlove her if she seemed stupid. \"Is it safe to leave him behind?\" \\n  97\\n\\nPrince Joffrey looked annoyed that she would even ask. \"Have no fear, lady. I am almost a man grown, \\nand I don\\'t fight with wood like your brothers. All I need is this.\" He drew his sword and showed it to \\nher; a longsword adroitly shrunken to suit a boy of twelve, gleaming blue steel, castle-forged and \\ndouble-edged, with a leather grip and a lion\\'s-head pommel in gold. Sansa exclaimed over it admiringly, \\nand Joffrey looked pleased. \"I call it Lion\\'s Tooth,\" he said. \\nAnd so they left her direwolf and his bodyguard behind them, while they ranged east along the north \\nbank of the Trident with no company save Lion\\'s Tooth. \\nIt was a glorious day, a magical day. The air was warm and heavy with the scent of flowers, and the \\nwoods here had a gentle beauty that Sansa had never seen in the north. Prince Joffrey\\'s mount was a \\nblood bay courser, swift as the wind, and he rode it with reckless abandon, so fast that Sansa was \\nhard-pressed to keep up on her mare. It was a day for adventures. They explored the caves by the \\nriverbank, and tracked a shadowcat to its lair, and when they grew hungry, Joffrey found a holdfast by its \\nsmoke and told them to fetch food and wine for their prince and his lady. They dined on trout fresh from \\nthe river, and Sansa drank more wine than she had ever drunk before. \"My father only lets us have one \\ncup, and only at feasts,\" she confessed to her prince. \\n\"My betrothed can drink as much as she wants,\" Joffrey said, refilling her cup. \\nThey went more slowly after they had eaten. Joffrey sang for her as \\nthey rode, his voice high and sweet and pure. Sansa was a little dizzy from the wine. \"Shouldn\\'t we be \\nstarting back?\" she asked. \\n\"Soon,\" Joffrey said. \"The battleground is right up ahead, where the river bends. That was where my \\nfather killed Rhaegar Targaryen, you know. He smashed in his chest, crunch, right through the armor.\" \\nJoffrey swung an imaginary warhammer to show her how it was done. \"Then my uncle Jaime killed old \\nAerys, and my father was king. What\\'s that sound?\" \\nSansa heard it too, floating through the woods, a kind of wooden clattering, snack snack snack. \"I don\\'t \\nknow,\" she said. It made her nervous, though. \"Joffrey, let\\'s go back.\" \\n\"I want to see what it is.\" Joffrey turned his horse in the direction of the sounds, and Sansa had no choice \\nbut to follow. The noises grew louder and more distinct, the clack of wood on wood, and as they grew \\ncloser they heard heavy breathing as well, and now and then a grunt. \\n\"Someone\\'s there,\" Sansa said anxiously. She found herself thinking of Lady, wishing the direwolf was \\nwith her. \\n\"You\\'re safe with me.\" Joffrey drew his Lion\\'s Tooth from its sheath. The sound of steel on leather made \\nher tremble. \"This way,\" he said, riding through a stand of trees. \\nBeyond, in a clearing overlooking the river, they came upon a boy and a girl playing at knights. Their \\nswords were wooden sticks, broom handles from the look of them, and they were rushing across the \\ngrass, swinging at each other lustily. The boy was years older, a head taller, and much stronger, and he \\nwas pressing the attack. The girl, a scrawny thing in soiled leathers, was dodging and managing to get her \\nstick in the way of most of the boy\\'s blows, but not all. When she tried to lunge at him, he caught her \\n  98\\n\\nstick with his own, swept it aside, and slid his wood down hard on her fingers. She cried out and lost her \\nweapon. \\nPrince Joffrey laughed. The boy looked around, wide-eyed and startled, and dropped his stick in the \\ngrass. The girl glared at them, sucking on her knuckles to take the sting out, and Sansa was horrified. \\n\\'Arya?\" she called out incredulously. \\n\"Go away,\" Arya shouted back at them, angry tears in her eyes. \"What are you doing here? Leave us \\nalone.\" \\nJoffrey glanced from Arya to Sansa and back again. \"Your sister?\" She nodded, blushing. Joffrey \\nexamined the boy, an ungainly lad with a coarse, freckled face and thick red hair. \"And who are you, \\nboy?\" he asked in a commanding tone that took no notice of the fact that the other was a year his senior. \\n\"Mycah,\" the boy muttered. He recognized the prince and averted his eyes. \"M\\'Iord.\" \\n\"He\\'s the butcher\\'s boy,\" Sansa said. \\n\"He\\'s my friend,\" Arya said sharply. \"You leave him alone.\" \\n\"A butcher\\'s boy who wants to be a knight, is it?\" Joffrey swung down from his mount, sword in hand. \\n\"Pick up your sword, butcher\\'s boy,\" he said, his eyes bright with amusement. \"Let us see how good you \\nare.\" \\nMycah stood there, frozen with fear. \\nJoffrey walked toward him. \"Go on, pick it up. Or do you only fight little girls?\" \\n\"She ast me to, m\\'lord,\" Mycah said. \"She ast me to.\" \\nSansa had only to glance at Arya and see the flush on her sister\\'s face to know the boy was telling the \\ntruth, but Joffrey was in no mood to listen. The wine had made him wild. \"Are you going to pick up your \\nsword?\" \\nMycah shook his head. \"It\\'s only a stick, m\\'lord. It\\'s not no sword, it\\'s only a stick.\" \\n\"And you\\'re only a butcher\\'s boy, and no knight.\" Joffrey lifted Lion\\'s Tooth and laid its point on \\nMycah\\'s cheek below the eye, as the butcher\\'s boy stood trembling. \"That was my lady\\'s sister you were \\nhitting, do you know that?\" A bright bud of blood blossomed where his sword pressed into Mycah\\'s \\nflesh, and a slow red line trickled down the boy\\'s cheek. \\n\"Stop it!\" Arya screamed. She grabbed up her fallen stick. \\nSansa was afraid. \"Arya, you stay out of this.\" \\n\"I won\\'t hurt him . . . much,\" Prince Joffrey told Arya, never taking his eyes off the butcher\\'s boy. \\nArya went for him. \\n  99\\n\\nSansa slid off her mare, but she was too slow. Arya swung with both hands. There was a loud crack as \\nthe wood split against the back of the prince\\'s head, and then everything happened at once before \\nSansa\\'s horrified eyes. Joffrey staggered and whirled around, roaring curses. Mycah ran for the trees as \\nfast as his legs would take him. Arya swung at the prince again, but this time Joffrey caught the blow on \\nLion\\'s Tooth and sent her broken stick flying from her hands. The back of his head was all bloody and \\nhis eyes were on fire. Sansa was shrieking, \"No, no, stop it, stop it, both of you, you\\'re spoiling it,\" but no \\none was listening. Arya scooped up a rock and hurled it at Joffrey\\'s head. She hit his horse instead, and \\nthe blood bay reared and went galloping off after Mycah. \"Stop it, don\\'t, stop it!\" Sansa screamed. \\nJoffrey slashed at Arya with his sword, screaming obscenities, terrible words, filthy words. Arya darted \\nback, frightened now, but Joffrey followed, hounding \\nher toward the woods, backing her up against a tree. Sansa didn\\'t know what to do. She watched \\nhelplessly, almost blind from her tears. \\nThen a grey blur flashed past her, and suddenly Nymeria was there, leaping, jaws closing around \\nJofftey\\'s sword arm. The steel fell from his fingers as the wolf knocked him off his feet, and they rolled in \\nthe grass, the wolf snarling and ripping at him, the prince shrieking in pain. \"Get it off,\" he screamed. \"Get \\nit off!\" \\nArya\\'s voice cracked like a whip. \"Nymefia!\" \\nThe direwolf let go of Joffrey and moved to Arya\\'s side. The prince lay in the grass, whimpering, \\ncradling his mangled arm. His shirt was soaked in blood. Arya said, \"She didn\\'t hurt you . . . much.\" She \\npicked up Lion\\'s Tooth where it had fallen, and stood over him, holding the sword with both hands. \\nJofftey made a scared whimpery sound as he looked up at her. \"No,\" he said, \"don\\'t hurt me. I\\'ll tell my \\nmother.\" \\n\"You leave him alone!\" Sansa screamed at her sister. \\nArya whirled and heaved the sword into the air, putting her whole body into the throw. The blue steel \\nflashed in the sun as the sword spun out over the river. It hit the water and vanished with a splash. Joffrey \\nmoaned. Arya ran off to her horse, Nymeria loping at her heels. \\nAfter they had gone, Sansa went to Prince Joffrey. His eyes were closed in pain, his breath ragged. \\nSansa knelt beside him. \"Joffrey,\" she sobbed. \"Oh, look what they did, look what they did. My poor \\nprince. Don\\'t be afraid. I\\'ll ride to the holdfast and bring help for you.\" Tenderly she reached out and \\nbrushed back his soft blond hair. \\nHis eyes snapped open and looked at her, and there was nothing but loathing there, nothing but the vilest \\ncontempt. \"Then go,\" he spit at her. \"And don\\'t touch me.\" \\nEDDARD \\nThey\\'ve found her, my lord.\" \\nNed rose quickly. \"Our men or Lannister\\'s?\" \\n  100\\n\\n\"T\"It was Jory,\" his steward Vayon Poole replied. \"She\\'s not been harmed.\" \\n\"Thank the gods,\" Ned said. His men had been searching for Arya for four days now, but the queen\\'s \\nmen had been out hunting as well. \"Where is she? Tell Jory to bring her here at once.\" \\n\"I am sorry, my lord,\" Poole told him. \"The guards on the gate were Lannister men, and they informed \\nthe queen when Jory brought her in. She\\'s being taken directly before the king . . .\" \\n\"Damn that woman!\" Ned said, striding to the door. \"Find Sansa and bring her to the audience chamber. \\nHer voice may be needed.\" He descended the tower steps in a red rage. He had led searches himself for \\nthe first three days, and had scarcely slept an hour since Arya had disappeared. This morning he had \\nbeen so heartsick and weary he could scarcely stand, but now his fury was on him, filling him with \\nstrength. \\nMen called out to him as he crossed the castle yard, but Ned ignored them in his haste. He would have \\nrun, but he was still the King\\'s Hand, and a Hand must keep his dignity. He was aware of the eyes that \\nfollowed him, of the muttered voices wondering what he would do. \\nThe castle was a modest holding a half day\\'s ride south of the Trident. The royal party had made \\nthemselves the uninvited guests of its lord, Ser Raymun Darry, while the hunt for Arya and the butcher\\'s \\nboy was conducted on both sides of the river. They were not welcome visitors. Ser Raymun lived under \\nthe king\\'s peace, but his family had fought beneath Rhaegar\\'s dragon banners at the Trident, and his three \\nolder brothers had died there, a truth neither Robert nor Ser Raymun had forgotten. With king\\'s men, \\nDarry men, Lannister men, and Stark men all crammed into a castle far too small for them, tensions \\nburned hot and heavy. \\nThe king had appropriated Ser Raymun\\'s audience chamber, and that was where Ned found them. The \\nroom was crowded when he burst in. Too crowded, he thought; left alone, he and Robert might have \\nbeen able to settle the matter amicably. \\nRobert was slumped in Darry\\'s high seat at the far end of the room, his face closed and sullen. Cersei \\nLannister and her son stood beside him. The queen had her hand on Joffrey\\'s shoulder. Thick silken \\nbandages still covered the boy\\'s arm. \\nArya stood in the center of the room, alone but for Jory Cassel, every eye upon her. \"Arya,\" Ned called \\nloudly. He went to her, his boots ringing on the stone floor. When she saw him, she cried out and began \\nto sob. \\nNed went to one knee and took her in his arms. She was shaking. \"I\\'m sorry,\" she sobbed, \"I\\'m sorry, \\nI\\'m sorry.\" \\n\"I know,\" he said. She felt so tiny in his arms, nothing but a scrawny little girl. It was hard to see how she \\nhad caused so much trouble. \"Are you hurt?\" \\n\"No.\" Her face was dirty, and her tears left pink tracks down her cheeks. \"Hungry some. I ate some \\nberries, but there was nothing else.\" \\n\"We\\'ll feed you soon enough,\" Ned promised. He rose to face the king. \"What is the meaning of this?\" \\n  101\\n\\nHis eyes swept the room, searching for friendly faces. But for his own men, they were few enough. Ser \\nRaymun Darry guarded his look well. Lord Renly wore a half smile that might mean anything, and old Ser \\nBarristan was grave; the rest were Lannister men, and hostile. Their only good fortune was that both \\nJaime Lannister and Sandor Clegane were missing, leading searches north of the Trident. \"Why was I not \\ntold that my daughter had been found?\" Ned demanded, his voice ringing. \"Why was she not brought to \\nme at once?\" \\nHe spoke to Robert, but it was Cersei Lannister who answered. \"How dare you speak to your king in \\nthat manner!\" \\nAt that, the king stirred. \"Quiet, woman,\" he snapped. He straightened \\nin his seat. \"I am sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. It seemed best to bring her here and \\nget the business done with quickly.\" \\n\"And what business is that?\" Ned put ice in his voice. \\nThe queen stepped forward. \"You know full well, Stark. This girl of yours attacked my son. Her and her \\nbutcher\\'s boy. That animal of hers tried to tear his arm off.\" \\n\"That\\'s not true,\" Arya said loudly. \"She just bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.\" \\n\"Joff told us what happened,\" the queen said. \"You and the butcher boy beat him with clubs while you \\nset your wolf on him.\" \\n\"That\\'s not how it was,\" Arya said, close to tears again. Ned put a hand on her shoulder. \\n\"Yes it is!\" Prince Joffrey insisted. \"They all attacked me, and she threw Lion\\'s Tooth in the river!\" Ned \\nnoticed that he did not so much as glance at Arya as he spoke. \\n\"Liar!\" Arya yelled. \\n\"Shut up!\" the prince yelled back. \\n\"Enough!\" the king roared, rising from his seat, his voice thick with irritation. Silence fell. He glowered at \\nArya through his thick beard. \"Now, child, you will tell me what happened. Tell it all, and tell it true. It is \\na great crime to lie to a king.\" Then he looked over at his son. \"When she is done, you will have your \\nturn. Until then, hold your tongue.\" \\nAs Arya began her story, Ned heard the door open behind him. He glanced back and saw Vayon Poole \\nenter with Sansa. They stood quietly at the back of the hall as Arya spoke. When she got to the part \\nwhere she threw Joffrey\\'s sword into the middle of the Trident, Renly Baratheon began to laugh. The king \\nbristled. \"Ser Barristan, escort my brother from the hall before he chokes.\" \\nLord Renly stifled his laughter. \"My brother is too kind. I can find the door myself.\" He bowed to \\nJoffrey. \"Perchance later you\\'ll tell me how a nine-year-old girl the size of a wet rat managed to disarm \\nyou with a broom handle and throw your sword in the river.\" As the door swung shut behind him, Ned \\nheard him say, \"Lion\\'s Tooth,\" and guffaw once more. \\n  102\\n\\nPrince Joffrey was pale as he began his very different version of events. When his son was done talking, \\nthe king rose heavily from his seat, looking like a man who wanted to be anywhere but here. \"What in all \\nthe seven hells am I supposed to make of this? He says one thing, she says another.\" \\n\"They were not the only ones present,\" Ned said. \"Sansa, come \\nhere.\" Ned had heard her version of the story the night Arya had vanished. He knew the truth. \"Tell us \\nwhat happened.\" \\nHis eldest daughter stepped forward hesitantly. She was dressed in blue velvets trimmed with white, a \\nsilver chain around her neck. Her thick auburn hair had been brushed until it shone. She blinked at her \\nsister, then at the young prince. \"I don\\'t know,\" she said tearfully, looking as though she wanted to bolt. \"I \\ndon\\'t remember. Everything happened so fast, I didn\\'t see . . .\" \\n\"You rotten!\" Arya shrieked. She flew at her sister like an arrow, knocking Sansa down to the ground, \\npummeling her. \"Liar, liar, liar, liar.\" \\n\"Arya, stop it!\" Ned shouted. Jory pulled her off her sister, kicking. Sansa was pale and shaking as Ned \\nlifted her back to her feet. \"Are you hurt?\" he asked, but she was staring at Arya, and she did not seem \\nto hear. \\n\"The girl is as wild as that filthy animal of hers,\" Cersei Lannister said. \"Robert, I want her punished.\" \\n\"Seven hells,\" Robert swore. \"Cersei, look at her. She\\'s a child. What would you have me do, whip her \\nthrough the streets? Damn it, children fight. It\\'s over. No lasting harm was done.\" \\nThe queen was furious. \"Joff will carry those scars for the rest of his life.\" \\nRobert Baratheon looked at his eldest son. \"So he will. Perhaps they will teach him a lesson. Ned, see \\nthat your daughter is disciplined. I will do the same with my son.\" \\n\"Gladly, Your Grace,\" Ned said with vast relief. \\nRobert started to walk away, but the queen was not done. \"And what of the direwolf?\" she called after \\nhim. \"What of the beast that savaged your son?\" \\nThe king stopped, turned back, frowned. \"I\\'d forgotten about the damned wolf.\" \\nNed could see Arya tense in Jory\\'s arms. Jory spoke up quickly. \"We found no trace of the direwolf, \\nYour Grace.\" \\nRobert did not look unhappy. \"No? So be it.\" \\nThe queen raised her voice. \"A hundred golden dragons to the man who brings me its skin!\" \\n\"A costly pelt,\" Robert grumbled. \"I want no part of this, woman. You can damn well buy your furs with \\nLannister gold.\" \\nThe queen regarded him coolly. \"I had not thought you so niggardly. The king I\\'d thought to wed would \\n  103\\n\\nhave laid a wolfskin across my bed before the sun went down.\" \\nRobert\\'s face darkened with anger. \"That would be a fine trick, without a wolf.\" \\n\"We have a wolf,\" Cersei Lannister said. Her voice was very quiet, but her green eyes shone with \\ntriumph. \\nIt took them all a moment to comprehend her words, but when they did, the king shrugged irritably. \"As \\nyou will. Have Ser Ilyn see to it.\" \\n\"Robert, you cannot mean this,\" Ned protested. \\nThe king was in no mood for more argument. \"Enough, Ned, I will hear no more. A direwolf is a savage \\nbeast. Sooner or later it would have turned on your girl the same way the other did on my son. Get her a \\ndog, she\\'ll be happier for it.\" \\nThat was when Sansa finally seemed to comprehend. Her eyes were frightened as they went to her \\nfather. \"He doesn\\'t mean Lady, does he?\" She saw the truth on his face. \"No,\" she said. \"No, not Lady, \\nLady didn\\'t bite anybody, she\\'s good . . .\" \\n\"Lady wasn\\'t there,\" Arya shouted angrily. \"You leave her alone!\" \\n\"Stop them,\" Sansa pleaded, \"don\\'t let them do it, please, please, it wasn\\'t Lady, it was Nymeria, Arya \\ndid it, you can\\'t, it wasn\\'t Lady, don\\'t let them hurt Lady, I\\'ll make her be good, I promise, I promise . . .\" \\nShe started to cry. \\nAll Ned could do was take her in his arms and hold her while she wept. He looked across the room at \\nRobert. His old friend, closer than any brother. \"Please, Robert. For the love you bear me. For the love \\nyou bore my sister. Please.\" \\nThe king looked at them for a long moment, then turned his eyes on his wife. \"Damn you, Cersei,\" he \\nsaid with loathing. \\nNed stood, gently disengaging himself from Sansa\\'s grasp. All the weariness of the past four days had \\nreturned to him. \"Do it yourself then, Robert,\" he said in a voice cold and sharp as steel. \"At least have \\nthe courage to do it yourself.\" \\nRobert looked at Ned with flat, dead eyes and left without a word, his footsteps heavy as lead. Silence \\nfilled the hall. \\n\"Where is the direwolf?\" Cersei Lannister asked when her husband was gone. Beside her, Prince Joffrey \\nwas smiling. \\n\"The beast is chained up outside the gatehouse, Your Grace,\" Ser Barristan Selmy answered reluctantly. \\n\"Send for Ilyn Payne.\" \\n\"No,\" Ned said. \"Jory, take the girls back to their rooms and bring me Ice.\" The words tasted of bile in \\nhis throat, but he forced them out. \"If it must be done, I will do it.\" \\n  104\\n\\nCersei Lannister regarded him suspiciously. \"You, Stark? Is this some trick? Why would you do such a \\nthing?\" \\nThey were all staring at him, but it was Sansa\\'s look that cut. \"She is of the north. She deserves better \\nthan a butcher.\" \\nHe left the room with his eyes burning and his daughter\\'s wails echoing in his ears, and found the direwolf \\npup where they chained her. Ned sat beside her for a while. \"Lady,\" he said, tasting the name. He had \\nnever paid much attention to the names the children had picked, but looking at her now, he knew that \\nSansa had chosen well. She was the smallest of the litter, the prettiest, the most gentle and trusting. She \\nlooked at him with bright golden eyes, and he ruffled her thick grey fur. \\nShortly, Jory brought him Ice. \\nWhen it was over, he said, \"Choose four men and have them take the body north. Bury her at \\nWinterfell.\" \\n\"All that way?\" Jory said, astonished. \\n\"All that way,\" Ned affirmed. \"The Lannister woman shall never have this skin.\" \\nHe was walking back to the tower to give himself up to sleep at last when Sandor Clegane and his riders \\ncame pounding through the castle gate, back from their hunt. \\nThere was something slung over the back of his destrier, a heavy shape wrapped in a bloody cloak. \"No \\nsign of your daughter, Hand,\" the Hound rasped down, \"but the day was not wholly wasted. We got her \\nlittle pet.\" He reached back and shoved the burden off, and it fell with a thump in front of Ned. \\nBending, Ned pulled back the cloak, dreading the words he would have to find for Arya, but it was not \\nNymeria after all. It was the butcher\\'s boy, Mycah, his body covered in dried blood. He had been cut \\nalmost in half from shoulder to waist by some terrible blow struck from above. \\n\"You rode him down,\" Ned said. \\nThe Hound\\'s eyes seemed to glitter through the steel of that hideous dog\\'s-head helm. \"He ran.\" He \\nlooked at Ned\\'s face and laughed. \"But not very fast.\" \\nBRAN \\nIt seemed as though he had been falling for years. \\nFly, a voice whispered in the darkness, but Bran did not know \\'thow to fly, so all he could do was fall. \\nMaester Luwin made a little boy of clay, baked him till he was hard and brittle, dressed him in Bran\\'s \\nclothes, and flung him off a roof. Bran remembered the way he shattered. \"But I never fall,\" he said, \\nfalling. \\n  105\\n\\nThe ground was so far below him he could barely make it out through the grey mists that whirled around \\nhim, but he could feel how fast he was falling, and he knew what was waiting for him down there. Even in \\ndreams, you could not fall forever. He would wake up in the instant before he hit the ground, he knew. \\nYou always woke up in the instant before you hit the ground. \\nAnd if you don\\'t? the voice asked. \\nThe ground was closer now, still far far away, a thousand miles away, but closer than it had been. It was \\ncold here in the darkness. There was no sun, no stars, only the ground below coming up to smash him, \\nand the grey mists, and the whispering voice. He wanted to cry. \\nNot cry. Fly. \\n\"I can\\'t fly,\" Bran said. \"I can\\'t, I can\\'t \\nHow do you know? Have you ever tried? \\nThe voice was high and thin. Bran looked around to see where it \\nwas coming from. A crow was spiraling down with him, just out of reach, following him as he fell. \"Help \\nme,\" he said. \\nI\\'m trying, the crow replied. Say, got any corn? \\nBran reached into his pocket as the darkness spun dizzily around him. When he pulled his hand out, \\ngolden kernels slid from between his fingers into the air. They fell with him. \\nThe crow landed on his hand and began to eat. \\n\"Are you really a crow?\" Bran asked. \\nAre you really falling? the crow asked back. \\n\"It\\'s just a dream,\" Bran said. \\nIs it? asked the crow. \\n\"I\\'ll wake up when I hit the ground,\" Bran told the bird. \\nYou\\'ll die when you hit the ground, the crow said. It went back to eating corn. \\nBran looked down. He could see mountains now, their peaks white with snow, and the silver thread of \\nrivers in dark woods. He closed his eyes and began to cry. \\nThat won\\'t do any good, the crow said. I told you, the answer is flying, not crying. How hard can it be? \\nI\\'m doing it. The crow took to the air and flapped around Bran\\'s hand. \\n\"You have wings,\" Bran pointed out. \\n  106\\n\\nMaybe you do too. \\nBran felt along his shoulders, groping for feathers. \\nThere are different kinds of wings, the crow said. \\nBran was staring at his arms, his legs. He was so skinny, just skin stretched taut over bones. Had he \\nalways been so thin? He tried to remember. A face swam up at him out of the grey mist, shining with \\nlight, golden. \"The things I do for love,\" it said. \\nBran screamed. \\nThe crow took to the air, cawing. Not that, it shrieked at him. Forget that, you do not need it now, put it \\naside, put it away. It landed on Bran\\'s shoulder, and pecked at him, and the shining golden face was \\ngone. \\nBran was falling faster than ever. The grey mists howled around him as he plunged toward the earth \\nbelow. \"What are you doing to me?\" he asked the crow, tearful. \\nTeaching you how to fly. \\n\"I can\\'t fly!\" \\nYou\\'re flying tight now. \\n,,Fm falling!\" \\nEvery flight begins with a fall, the crow said. Look down. \\n\"I\\'m afraid . . .\" \\nLOOKDOWN! \\nBran looked down, and felt his insides turn to water. The ground was rushing up at him now. The whole \\nworld was spread out below him, a tapestry of white and brown and green. He could see everything so \\nclearly that for a moment he forgot to be afraid. He could see the whole realm, and everyone in it. \\nHe saw Winterfell as the eagles see it, the tall towers looking squat and stubby from above, the castle \\nwalls just lines in the dirt. He saw Maester Luwin on his balcony, studying the sky through a polished \\nbronze tube and frowning as he made notes in a book. He saw his brother Robb, taller and stronger than \\nhe remembered him, practicing swordplay in the yard with real steel in his hand. He saw Hodor, the \\nsimple giant from the stables, carrying an anvil to Mikken\\'s forge, hefting it onto his shoulder as easily as \\nanother man might heft a bale of hay. At the heart of the godswood, the great white weirwood brooded \\nover its reflection in the black pool, its leaves rustling in a chill wind. When it felt Bran watching, it lifted \\nits eyes from the still waters and stared back at him knowingly. \\nHe looked east, and saw a galley racing across the waters of the Bite. He saw his mother sitting alone in \\na cabin, looking at a bloodstained knife on a table in front of her, as the rowers pulled at their oars and \\n  107\\n\\nSer Rodrik leaned across a rail, shaking and heaving. A storm was gathering ahead of them, a vast dark \\nroaring lashed by lightning, but somehow they could not see it. \\nHe looked south, and saw the great blue-green rush of the Trident. He saw his father pleading with the \\nking, his face etched with grief. He saw Sansa crying herself to sleep at night, and he saw Arya watching \\nin silence and holding her secrets hard in her heart. There were shadows all around them. One shadow \\nwas dark as ash, with the terrible face of a hound. Another was armored like the sun, golden and \\nbeautiful. Over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone, but when he opened his visor, there \\nwas nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood. \\nHe lifted his eyes and saw clear across the narrow sea, to the Free Cities and the green Dothraki sea \\nand beyond, to Vaes Dothrak under its mountain, to the fabled lands of the Jade Sea, to Asshai by the \\nShadow, where dragons stirred beneath the sunrise. \\nFinally he looked north. He saw the Wall shining like blue crystal, and his bastard brother Jon sleeping \\nalone in a cold bed, his skin growing pale and hard as the memory of all warmth fled from him. And he \\nlooked past the Wall, past endless forests cloaked in snow, past the frozen shore and the great \\nblue-white rivers of ice and the dead plains where nothing grew or lived. North and north and north he \\nlooked, to the curtain of light at the end of the world, and then beyond that curtain. He looked deep into \\nthe heart of winter, and then he cried out, afraid, and the heat of his tears burned on his cheeks. \\nNow you know, the crow whispered as it sat on his shoulder. Now you know why you must live. \\n\"Why?\" Bran said, not understanding, falling, falling. \\nBecause winter is coming. \\nBran looked at the crow on his shoulder, and the crow looked back. It had three eyes, and the third eye \\nwas full of a terrible knowledge. Bran looked down. There was nothing below him now but snow and \\ncold and death, a frozen wasteland where jagged blue-white spires of ice waited to embrace him. They \\nflew up at him like spears. He saw the bones of a thousand other dreamers impaled upon their points. He \\nwas desperately afraid. \\n\"Can a man still be brave if he\\'s afraid?\" he heard his own voice saying, small and far away. \\nAnd his father\\'s voice replied to him. \"That is the only time a man can be brave.\" \\nNow, Bran, the crow urged. Choose. Fly or die. \\nDeath reached for him, screaming. \\nBran spread his arms and flew. \\nWings unseen drank the wind and filled and pulled him upward. The terrible needles of ice receded \\nbelow him. The sky opened up above. Bran soared. It was better than climbing. It was better than \\nanything. The world grew small beneath him. \\n\"I\\'m flying!\" he cried out in delight. \\n  108\\n\\nI\\'ve noticed, said the three-eyed crow. It took to the air, flapping its wings in his face, slowing him, \\nblinding him. He faltered in the air as its pinions beat against his cheeks. Its beak stabbed at him fiercely, \\nand Bran felt a sudden blinding pain in the middle of his forehead, between his eyes. \\n\"What are you doing?\" he shrieked. \\nThe crow opened its beak and cawed at him, a shrill scream of fear, and the grey mists shuddered and \\nswirled around him and ripped away like a veil, and he saw that the crow was really a woman, a serving \\nwoman with long black hair, and he knew her from somewhere, from Winterfell, yes, that was it, he \\nremembered her now, and then he realized that he was in Winterfell, in a bed- high in some chilly tower \\nroom, and the black-haired woman dropped a basin of water to shatter on the floor and ran down the \\nsteps, shouting, \"He\\'s awake, he\\'s awake, he\\'s awake.\" \\nBran touched his forehead, between his eyes. The place where the \\ncrow had pecked him was still burning, but there was nothing there, no blood, no wound. He felt weak \\nand dizzy. He tried to get out of bed, but nothing happened. \\nAnd then there was movement beside the bed, and something landed lightly on his legs. He felt nothing. \\nA pair of yellow eyes looked into his own, shining like the sun. The window was open and it was cold in \\nthe room, but the warmth that came off the wolf enfolded him like a hot bath. His pup, Bran realized . . . \\nor was it? He was so big now. He reached out to pet him, his hand trembling like a leaf. \\nWhen his brother Robb burst into the room, breathless from his dash up the tower steps, the direwolf \\nwas licking Bran\\'s face. Bran looked up calmly. \"His name is Summer,\" he said. \\nCATELYN \\n\"We will make King\\'s Landing within the hour.\" \\nCatelyn turned away from the rail and forced herself to smile. \"Your oarmen have done well by us, \\nCaptain. Each one of them shall have a silver stag, as a token of my gratitude.\" \\nCaptain Moreo Turnitis favored her with a half bow. \"You are far too generous, Lady Stark. The honor \\nof carrying a great lady like yourself is all the reward they need.\" \\n\"But they\\'ll take the silver anyway.\" \\nMoreo smiled. \"As you say.\" He spoke the Common Tongue fluently, with only the slightest hint of a \\nTyroshi accent. He\\'d been plying the narrow sea for thirty years, he\\'d told her, as oarman, quartermaster, \\nand finally captain of his own trading galleys. The Stonn Dancer was his fourth ship, and his fastest, a \\ntwo-masted galley of sixty oars. \\nShe had certainly been the fastest of the ships available in White Harbor when Catelyn and Ser Rodrik \\n  109\\n\\nCassel had arrived after their headlong gallop downriver. The Tyroshi were notorious for their avarice, \\nand Ser Rodrik had argued for hiring a fishing sloop out of the Three Sisters, but Catelyn had insisted on \\nthe galley. It was good that she had. The winds had been against them much of the voyage, and without \\nthe galley\\'s oars they\\'d still be beating their way past the \\nFingers, instead of skimming toward King\\'s Landing and journey\\'s end. \\nSo close, she thought. Beneath the linen bandages, her fingers still throbbed where the dagger had bitten. \\nThe pain was her scourge, Catelyn felt, lest she forget. She could not bend the last two fingers on her left \\nhand, and the others would never again be dexterous. Yet that was a small enough price to pay for \\nBran\\'s life. \\nSer Rodrik chose that moment to appear on deck. \"My good friend,\" said Moreo through his forked \\ngreen beard. The Tyroshi loved bright colors, even in their facial hair. \"It is so fine to see you looking \\nbetter.\" \\n\"Yes,\" Ser Rodrik agreed. \"I haven\\'t wanted to die for almost two days now.\" He bowed to Catelyn. \\n\"My lady.\" \\nHe was looking better. A shade thinner than he had been when they set out from White Harbor, but \\nalmost himself again. The strong winds in the Bite and the roughness of the narrow sea had not agreed \\nwith him, and he\\'d almost gone over the side when the storm seized them unexpectedly off Dragonstone, \\nyet somehow he had clung to a rope until three of Moreo\\'s men could rescue him and carry him safely \\nbelow decks. \\n\"The captain was just telling me that our voyage is almost at an end,\" she said. \\nSer Rodrik managed a wry smile. \"So soon?\" He looked odd without his great white side whiskers; \\nsmaller somehow, less fierce, and ten years older. Yet back on the Bite it had seemed prudent to submit \\nto a crewman\\'s razor, after his whiskers had become hopelessly befouled for the third time while he \\nleaned over the rail and retched into the swirling winds. \\n\"I will leave you to discuss your business,\" Captain Moreo said. He bowed and took his leave of them. \\nThe galley skimmed the water like a dragonfly, her oars rising and falling in perfect time. Ser Rodrik held \\nthe rail and looked out over the passing shore. \"I have not been the most valiant of protectors.\" \\nCatelyn touched his arm. \"We are here, Ser Rodrik, and safely. That is all that truly matters.\" Her hand \\ngroped beneath her cloak, her fingers stiff and fumbling. The dagger was still at her side. She found she \\nhad to touch it now and then, to reassure herself. \"Now we must reach the king\\'s master-at-arms, and \\npray that he can be trusted.\" \\n\"Ser Aron Santagar is a vain man, but an honest one.\" Ser Rodrik\\'s hand went to his face to stroke his \\nwhiskers and discovered once again that they were gone. He looked nonplussed. \"He may know the \\nblade, \\nyes ... but, my lady, the moment we go ashore we are at risk. And there are those at court who will \\n  110\\n\\nknow you on sight.\" \\nCatelyn\\'s mouth grew tight. \"Littlefinger,\" she murmured. His face swam up before her; a boy\\'s face, \\nthough he was a boy no longer. His father had died several years before, so he was Lord Baelish now, \\nyet still they called him Littlefinger. Her brother Edmure had given him that name, long ago at Riverrun. \\nHis family\\'s modest holdings were on the smallest of the Fingers, and Petyr had been slight and short for \\nhis age. \\nSer Rodrik cleared his throat. \"Lord Baelish once, ah His \\nthought trailed off uncertainly in search of the polite word. \\nCatelyn was past delicacy. \"He was my father\\'s ward. We grew up together in Riverrun. I thought of him \\nas a brother, but his feelings for me were . . . more than brotherly. When it was announced that I was to \\nwed Brandon Stark, Petyr challenged for the right to my hand. It was madness. Brandon was twenty, \\nPetyr scarcely fifteen. I had to beg Brandon to spare Petyr\\'s life. He let him off with a scar. Afterward my \\nfather sent him away. I have not seen him since.\" She lifted her face to the spray, as if the brisk wind \\ncould blow the memories away. \"He wrote to me at Riverrun after Brandon was killed, but I burned the \\nletter unread. By then I knew that Ned would marry me in his brother\\'s place.\" \\nSer Rodrik\\'s fingers fumbled once again for nonexistent whiskers. \"Littlefinger sits on the small council \\nnow.\" \\n\"I knew he would rise high,\" Catelyn said. \"He was always clever, even as a boy, but it is one thing to be \\nclever and another to be wise. I wonder what the years have done to him.\" \\nHigh overhead, the far-eyes sang out from the rigging. Captain Moreo came scrambling across the deck, \\ngiving orders, and all around them the Stonn Dancer burst into frenetic activity as King\\'s Landing slid into \\nview atop its three high hills. \\nThree hundred years ago, Catelyn knew, those heights had been covered with forest, and only a handful \\nof fisherfolk had lived on the north shore of the Blackwater Rush where that deep, swift river flowed into \\nthe sea. Then Aegon the Conqueror had sailed from Dragonstone. It was here that his army had put \\nashore, and there on the highest hill that he built his first crude redoubt of wood and earth. \\nNow the city covered the shore as far as Catelyn could see; manses and arbors and granaries, brick \\nstorehouses and timbered inns and merchant\\'s stalls, taverns and graveyards and brothels, all piled one \\non another. She could hear the clamor of the fish market even at this distance. Between the buildings \\nwere broad roads lined with trees, \\nwandering crookback streets, and alleys so narrow that two men could not walk abreast. Visenya\\'s hill \\nwas crowned by the Great Sept of Baelor with its seven crystal towers. Across the city on the hill of \\nRhaenys stood the blackened walls of the Dragonpit, its huge dome collapsing into ruin, its bronze doors \\nclosed now for a century. The Street of the Sisters ran between them, straight as an arrow. The city walls \\nrose in the distance, high and strong. \\nA hundred quays lined the waterfront, and the harbor was crowded with ships. Deepwater fishing boats \\nand river runners came and went, ferrymen poled back and forth across the Blackwater Rush, trading \\ngalleys unloaded goods from Braavos and Pentos and Lys. Catelyn sp~ied the queen\\'s ornate barge, tied \\n  111\\n\\nup beside a fat-bellied whaler from the Port of Ibben, its hull black with tar, while upriver a dozen lean \\ngolden warships rested in their cribs, sails furled and cruel iron rams lapping at the water. \\nAnd above it all, frowning down from Aegon\\'s high hill, was the Red Keep; seven huge drum-towers \\ncrowned with iron ramparts, an immense grim barbican, vaulted halls and covered bridges, barracks and \\ndungeons and granaries, massive curtain walls studded with archers\\' nests, all fashioned of pale red stone. \\nAegon the Conqueror had commanded it built. His son Maegor the Cruel had seen it completed. \\nAfterward he had taken the heads of every stonemason, woodworker, and builder who had labored on \\nit. Only the blood of the dragon would ever know the secrets of the fortress the Dragonlords had built, he \\nvowed. \\nYet now the banners that flew from its battlements were golden, not black, and where the three-headed \\ndragon had once breathed fire, now pranced the crowned stag of House Baratheon. \\nA high-masted swan ship from the Summer Isles was beating out from port, its white sails huge with \\nwind. The Stonn Dancer moved past it, pulling steadily for shore. \\n\"My lady,\" Ser Rodrik said, \"I have thought on how best to proceed while I lay abed. You must not \\nenter the castle. I will go in your stead and bring Ser Aron to you in some safe place.\" \\nShe studied the old knight as the galley drew near to a pier. Moreo was shouting in the vulgar Valyrian \\nof the Free Cities. \"You would be as much at risk as I would.\" \\nSer Rodrik smiled. \"I think not. I looked at my reflection in the water earlier and scarcely recognized \\nmyself. My mother was the last person to see me without whiskers, and she is forty years dead. I believe \\nI am safe enough, my lady.\" \\nMoreo bellowed a command. As one, sixty oars lifted from the \\nriver, then reversed and backed water. The galley slowed. Another shout. The oars slid back inside the \\nhull. As they thumped against the dock, Tyroshi seamen leapt down to tie up. Moreo came bustling up, \\nall smiles. \"King\\'s Landing, my lady, as you did command, and never has a ship made a swifter or surer \\npassage. Will you be needing assistance to carry your things to the castle?\" \\n\"We shall not be going to the castle. Perhaps you can suggest an inn, someplace clean and comfortable \\nand not too far from the river.\" \\nThe Tyroshi fingered his forked green beard. \"Just so. I know of several establishments that might suit \\nyour needs. Yet first, if I may be so bold, there is the matter of the second half of the payment we agreed \\nupon. And of course the extra silver you were so kind as to promise. Sixty stags, I believe it was.\" \\n\"For the oarmen,\" Catelyn reminded him. \\n\"Oh, of a certainty,\" said Moreo. \"Though perhaps I should hold it for them until we return to Tyrosh. \\nFor the sake of their wives and children. If you give them the silver here, my lady, they will dice it away \\nor spend it all for a night\\'s pleasure.\" \\n\"There are worse things to spend money on,\" Ser Rodrik put in. \"Winter is coming.\" \\n  112\\n\\n\"A man must make his own choices,\" Catelyn said. \"They earned the silver. How they spend it is no \\nconcern of mine.\" \\n\"As you say, my lady,\" Moreo replied, bowing and smiling. \\nJust to be sure, Catelyn paid the oarmen herself, a stag to each man, and a copper to the two men who \\ncarried their chests halfway up Visenya\\'s hill to the inn that Moreo had suggested. It was a rambling old \\nplace on Eel Alley. The woman who owned it was a sour crone with a wandering eye who looked them \\nover suspiciously and bit the coin that Catelyn offered her to make sure it was real. Her rooms were large \\nand airy, though, and Moreo swore that her fish stew was the most savory in all the Seven Kingdoms. \\nBest of all, she had no interest in their names. \\n\"I think it best if you stay away from the common room,\" Ser Rodrik said, after they had settled in. \\n\"Even in a place like this, one never knows who may be watching.\" He wore ringmail, dagger, and \\nlongsword under a dark cloak with a hood he could pull up over his head. \"I will be back before nightfall, \\nwith Ser Aron,\" he promised. \"Rest now, my lady.\" \\nCatelyn was tired. The voyage had been long and fatiguing, and she was no longer as young as she had \\nbeen. Her windows opened on the alley and rooftops, with a view of the Blackwater beyond. She \\nwatched Ser Rodrik set off, striding briskly through the busy streets until he was \\nlost in the crowds, then decided to take his advice. The bedding was stuffed with straw instead of \\nfeathers, but she had no trouble falling asleep. \\nShe woke to a pounding on her door. \\nCatelyn sat up sharply. Outside the window, the rooftops of King\\'s Landing were red in the light of the \\nsetting sun. She had slept longer than she intended. A fist hammered at her door again, and a voice called \\nout, \"Open, in the name of the king.\" \\n\"A moment,\" she called out. She wrapped herself in her cloak. The dagger was on the bedside table. \\nShe snatched it up before she unlatched the heavy wooden door. \\nThe men who pushed into the room wore the black ringmail and golden cloaks of the City Watch. Their \\nleader smiled at the dagger in her hand and said, \"No need for that, m1ady. We\\'re to escort you to the \\ncastle.\" \\n\"By whose authority?\" she said. \\nHe showed her a ribbon. Catelyn felt her breath catch in her throat. The seal was a mockingbird, in grey \\nwax. \"Petyr,\" she said. So soon. Something must have happened to Ser Rodrik. She looked at the head \\nguardsman. \"Do you know who I am?\" \\n\"No, m\\'lady,\" he said. \"M\\'lord Littlefinger said only to bring you to him, and see that you were not \\nmistreated.\" \\nCatelyn nodded. \"You may wait outside while I dress.\" \\nShe bathed her hands in the basin and wrapped them in clean linen. Her fingers were thick and awkward \\n  113\\n\\nas she struggled to lace up her bodice and knot a drab brown cloak about her neck. How could \\nLittlefinger have known she was here? Ser Rodrik would never have told him. Old he might be, but he \\nwas stubborn, and loyal to a fault. Were they too late, had the Lannisters reached King\\'s Landing before \\nher? No, if that were true, Ned would be here too, and surely he would have come to her. How . . . ? \\nThen she thought, Moreo. The Tyroshi knew who they were and where they were, damn him. She \\nhoped he\\'d gotten a good price for the information. \\nThey had brought a horse for her. The lamps were being lit along the streets as they set out, and Catelyn \\nfelt the eyes of the city on her as she rode, surrounded by the guard in their golden cloaks. When they \\nreached the Red Keep, the portcullis was down and the great gates sealed for the night, but the castle \\nwindows were alive with flickering lights. The guardsmen left their mounts outside the walls and escorted \\nher through a narrow postern door, then up endless steps to a tower. \\nHe was alone in the room, seated at a heavy wooden table, an oil \\nlamp beside him as he wrote. When they ushered her inside, he set down his pen and looked at her. \\n\"Cat,\" he said quietly. \\n\"Why have I been brought here in this fashion?\" \\nHe rose and gestured brusquely to the guards. \"Leave us.\" The men departed. \"You were not \\nmistreated, I trust,\" he said after they had gone. \"I gave firm instructions.\" He noticed her bandages. \\n\"Your hands . . .\" \\nCatelyn ignored the implied question. \"I am not accustomed to being summoned like a serving wench,\" \\nshe said icily. \"As a boy, you still knew the meaning of courtesy.\" \\n\"I\\'ve angered you, my lady. That was never my intent.\" He looked contrite. The look brought back vivid \\nmemories for Catelyn. He had been a sly child, but after his mischiefs he always looked contrite; it was a \\ngift he had. The years had not changed him much. Petyr had been a small boy, and he had grown into a \\nsmall man, an inch or two shorter than Catelyn, slender and quick, with the sharp features she \\nremembered and the same laughing grey-green eyes. He had a little pointed chin beard now, and threads \\nof silver in his dark hair, though he was still shy of thirty. They went well with the silver mockingbird that \\nfastened his cloak. Even as a child, he had always loved his silver. \\n\"How did you know I was in the city?\" she asked him. \\n\"Lord Varys knows all,\" Petyr said with a sly smile. \"He will be joining us shortly, but I wanted to see \\nyou alone first. It has been too long, Cat. How many years?\" \\nCatelyn ignored his familiarity. There were more important questions. \"So it was the King\\'s Spider who \\nfound me.\" \\nLittlefinger winced. \"You don\\'t want to call him that. He\\'s very sensitive. Comes of being an eunuch, I \\nimagine. Nothing happens in this city without Varys knowing. Oftimes he knows about it before it \\nhappens. He has informants everywhere. His little birds, he calls them. One of his little birds heard about \\nyour visit. Thankfully, Varys came to me first.\" \\n  114\\n\\n\"Why you?\" \\nHe shrugged. \"Why not me? I am master of coin, the king\\'s own councillor. Selmy and Lord Renly rode \\nnorth to meet Robert, and Lord Stannis is gone to Dragonstone, leaving only Maester Pycelle and me. I \\nwas the obvious choice. I was ever a friend to your sister Lysa, Varys knows that.\" \\n\"Does Varys know about \\n\"Lord Varys knows everything . . . except why you are here.\" He lifted an eyebrow. \"Why are you \\nhere?\" \\n\"A wife is allowed to yearn for her husband, and if a mother needs her daughters close, who can tell her \\nno?\" \\nLittlefinger laughed. \"Oh, very good, my lady, but please don\\'t expect me to believe that. I know you too \\nwell. What were the Tully words again?\" \\nHer throat was dry. \"Family, Duty, Honor, \" she recited stiffly. He did know her too well. \\n\"Family, Duty, Honor,\" he echoed. \"All of which required you to remain in Winterfell, where our Hand \\nleft you. No, my lady, something has happened. This sudden trip of yours bespeaks a certain urgency. I \\nbeg of you, let me help. Old sweet friends should never hesitate to rely upon each other.\" There was a \\nsoft knock on the door. \"Enter,\" Littlefinger called out. \\nThe man who stepped through the door was plump, perfumed, powdered, and as hairless as an egg. He \\nwore a vest of woven gold thread over a loose gown of purple silk, and on his feet were pointed slippers \\nof soft velvet. \"Lady Stark,\" he said, taking her hand in both of his, \"to see you again after so many years \\nis such a joy.\" His flesh was soft and moist, and his breath smelled of lilacs. \"Oh, your poor hands. Have \\nyou burned yourself, sweet lady? The fingers are so delicate . . . Our good Maester Pycelle makes a \\nmarvelous salve, shall I send for a jar?\" \\nCatelyn slid her fingers from his grasp. \"I thank you, my lord, but my own Maester Luwin has already \\nseen to my hurts.\" \\nVarys bobbed his head. \"I was grievous sad to hear about your son. And him so young. The gods are \\ncruel.\" \\n\"On that we agree, Lord Varys,\" she said. The title was but a courtesy due him as a council member; \\nVarys was lord of nothing but the spiderweb, the master of none but his whisperers. \\nThe eunuch spread his soft hands. \"On more than that, I hope, sweet lady. I have great esteem for your \\nhusband, our new Hand, and I know we do both love King Robert.\" \\n\"Yes,\" she was forced to say. \"For a certainty.\" \\n\"Never has a king been so beloved as our Robert,\" quipped Littlefinger. He smiled slyly. \"At least in \\nLord Varys\\'s hearing.\" \\n\"Good lady,\" Varys said with great solicitude. \"There are men in the Free Cities with wondrous healing \\n  115\\n\\npowers. Say only the word, and I will send for one for your dear Bran.\" \\n\"Maester Luwin is doing all that can be done for Bran,\" she told him. She would not speak of Bran, not \\nhere, not with these men. She trusted Littlefinger only a little, and Varys not at all. She would not let \\nthem see her grief. \"Lord Baelish tells me that I have you to thank for bringing me here.\" \\nVarys giggled like a little girl. \"Oh, yes. I suppose I am guilty. I hope you forgive me, kind lady.\" He \\neased himself down into a seat and put his hands together. \"I wonder if we might trouble you to show us \\nthe dagger?\" \\nCatelyn Stark stared at the eunuch in stunned disbelief. He was a spider, she thought wildly, an \\nenchanter or worse. He knew things no one could possibly know, unless \"What have you done to Ser \\nRodrik?\" she demanded. \\nLittlefinger was lost. \"I feel rather like the knight who arrives at the battle without his lance. What dagger \\nare we talking about? Who is Ser Rodrik?\" \\n\"Ser Rodrik Cassel is master-at-arms at Winterfell,\" Varys informed him. \"I assure you, Lady Stark, \\nnothing at all has been done to the good knight. He did call here early this afternoon. He visited with Ser \\nAron Santagar in the armory, and they talked of a certain dagger. About sunset, they left the castle \\ntogether and walked to that dreadful hovel where you were staying. They are still there, drinking in the \\ncommon room, waiting for your return. Ser Rodrik was very distressed to find you gone.\" \\n\"How could you know all that?\" \\n\"The whisperings of little birds,\" Varys said, smiling. \"I know things, sweet lady. That is the nature of my \\nservice.\" He shrugged. \"You do have the dagger with you, yes?\" \\nCatelyn pulled it out from beneath her cloak and threw it down on the table in front of him. \"Here. \\nPerhaps your little birds will whisper the name of the man it belongs to.\" \\nVarys lifted the knife with exaggerated delicacy and ran a thumb along its edge. Blood welled, and he let \\nout a squeal and dropped the dagger back on the table. \\n\"Careful,\" Catelyn told him, \"it\\'s sharp.\" \\n\"Nothing holds an edge like Valyrian steel,\" Littlefinger said as Varys sucked at his bleeding thumb and \\nlooked at Catelyn with sullen admonition. Littlefinger hefted the knife lightly in his hand, testing the grip. \\nHe flipped it in the air, caught it again with his other hand. \"Such sweet balance. You want to find the \\nowner, is that the reason for this visit? You have no need of Ser Aron for that, my lady. You should have \\ncome to me.\" \\n\"And if I had,\" she said, \"what would you have told me?\" \\n\"I would have told you that there was only one knife like this at King\\'s Landing.\" He grasped the blade \\nbetween thumb and forefinger, \\n  116\\n\\ndrew it back over his shoulder, and threw it across the room with a practiced flick of his wrist. It struck \\nthe door and buried itself deep in the oak, quivering. \"It\\'s mine.\" \\n\"Yours?\" It made no sense. Petyr had not been at Winterfell. \\n\"Until the tourney on Prince Joffrey\\'s name day,\" he said, crossing the room to wrench the dagger from \\nthe wood. \"I backed Ser Jaime in the jousting, along with half the court.\" Petyr\\'s sheepish grin made him \\nlook half a boy again. \"When Loras Tyrell unhorsed him, many of us became a trifle poorer. Ser Jaime \\nlost a hundred golden dragons, the queen lost an emerald pendant, and I lost my knife. Her Grace got the \\nemerald back, but the winner kept the rest.\" \\n\"Who?\" Catelyn demanded, her mouth dry with fear. Her fingers ached with remembered pain. \\n\"The Imp,\" said Littlefinger as Lord Varys watched her face. \"Tyrion Lannister.\" \\nJON \\nThe courtyard rang to the song of swords. \\nUnder black wool, boiled leather, and mail, sweat trickled icily down Jon\\'s chest as he pressed the \\nattack. Grenn stumbled backward, defending himself clumsily. When he raised his sword, Jon went \\nunderneath it with a sweeping blow that crunched against the back of the other boy\\'s leg and sent him \\nstaggering. Grenn\\'s downcut was answered by an overhand that dented his helm. When he tried a \\nsideswing, Jon swept aside his blade and slammed a mailed forearm into his chest. Grenn lost his footing \\nand sat down hard in the snow. Jon knocked his sword from his fingers with a slash to his wrist that \\nbrought a cry of pain. \\n\"Enough!\" Ser Alliser Thorne had a voice with an edge like Valyrian steel. \\nGrenn cradled his hand. \"The bastard broke my wrist.\" \\n\"The bastard hamstrung you, opened your empty skull, and cut off your hand. Or would have, if these \\nblades had an edge. It\\'s fortunate for you that the Watch needs stableboys as well as rangers.\" Ser Alliser \\ngestured at Jeren and Toad. \"Get the Aurochs on his feet, he has funeral arrangements to make.\" \\nJon took off his helm as the other boys were pulling Grenn to his feet. The frosty morning air felt good on \\nhis face. He leaned on his \\nsword, drew a deep breath, and allowed himself a moment to savor the victory. \\n\"That is a longsword, not an old man\\'s cane,\" Ser Alliser said sharply. \"Are your legs hurting, Lord \\nSnow?\" \\nJon hated that name, a mockery that Ser Alliser had hung on him the first day he came to practice. The \\nboys had picked it up, and now he heard it everywhere. He slid the longsword back into its scabbard. \\n\"No,\" he replied. \\n  117\\n\\nThorne strode toward him, crisp black leathers whispering faintly as he moved. He was a compact man \\nof fifty years, spare and hard, with grey in his black hair and eyes like chips of onyx. \"The truth now,\" he \\ncommanded. \\n\"I\\'m tired,\" Jon admitted. His arm burned from the weight of the longsword, and he was starting to feel \\nhis bruises now that the fight was done. \\n\"What you are is weak.\" \\n\"I won.\" \\n\"No. The Aurochs lost.\" \\nOne of the other boys sniggered. Jon knew better than to reply. He had beaten everyone that Ser Alliser \\nhad sent against him, yet it gained him nothing. The master-at-arms served up only derision. Thorne hated \\nhim, Jon had decided; of course, he hated the other boys even worse. \\n\"That will be all,\" Thorne told them. \"I can only stomach so much ineptitude in any one day. If the Others \\never come for us, I pray they have archers, because you lot are fit for nothing more than arrow fodder.\" \\nJon followed the rest back to the armory, walking alone. He often walked alone here. There were \\nalmost twenty in the group he trained with, yet not one he could call a friend. Most were two or three \\nyears his senior, yet not one was half the fighter Robb had been at fourteen. Dareon was quick but afraid \\nof being hit. Pyp used his sword like a dagger, Jeren was weak as a girl, Grenn slow and clumsy. \\nHalder\\'s blows were brutally hard but he ran right into your attacks. The more time he spent with them, \\nthe more Jon despised them. \\nInside, Jon hung sword and scabbard from a hook in the stone wall, ignoring the others around him. \\nMethodically, he began to strip off his mail, leather, and sweat-soaked woolens. Chunks of coal burned \\nin iron braziers at either end of the long room, but Jon found himself shivering. The chill was always with \\nhim here. In a few years he would forget what it felt like to be warm. \\nThe weariness came on him suddenly, as he donned the roughspun \\nblacks that were their everyday wear. He sat on a bench, his fingers fumbling with the fastenings on his \\ncloak. So cold, he thought, remembering the warm halls of Winterfell, where the hot waters ran through \\nthe walls like blood through a man\\'s body. There was scant warmth to be found in Castle Black; the \\nwalls were cold here, and the people colder. \\nNo one had told him the Night\\'s Watch would be like this; no one except Tyrion Lannister. The dwarf \\nhad given him the truth on the road north, but by then it had been too late. Jon wondered if his father had \\nknown what the Wall would be like. He must have, he thought; that only made it hurt the worse. \\nEven his uncle had abandoned him in this cold place at the end of the world. Up here, the genial Benjen \\nStark he had known became a different person. He was First Ranger, and he spent his days and nights \\nwith Lord Commander Mormont and Maester Aemon and the other high officers, while Jon was given \\nover to the less than tender charge of Ser Alliser Thorne. \\n  118\\n\\nThree days after their arrival, Jon had heard that Benjen Stark was to lead a half-dozen men on a \\nranging into the haunted forest. That night he sought out his uncle in the great timbered common hall and \\npleaded to go with him. Benjen refused him curtly. \"This is not Winterfell,\" he told him as he cut his meat \\nwith fork and dagger. \"On the Wall, a man gets only what he earns. You\\'re no ranger, Jon, only a green \\nboy with the smell of summer still on you.\" \\nStupidly, Jon argued. \"I\\'ll be fifteen on my name day,\" he said. \"Almost a man grown.\" \\nBenjen Stark frowned. \"A boy you are, and a boy you\\'ll remain until Ser Alliser says you are fit to be a \\nman of the Night\\'s Watch. If you thought your Stark blood would win you easy favors, you were wrong. \\nWe put aside our old families when we swear our vows. Your father will always have a place in my \\nheart, but these are my brothers now.\" He gestured with his dagger at the men around them, all the hard \\ncold men in black. \\nJon rose at dawn the next day to watch his uncle leave. One of his rangers, a big ugly man, sang a \\nbawdy song as he saddled his garron, his breath steaming in the cold morning air. Ben Stark smiled at \\nthat, but he had no smile for his nephew. \"How often must I tell you no, Jon? We\\'ll speak when I return.\" \\nAs he watched his uncle lead his horse into the tunnel, Jon had remembered the things that Tyrion \\nLannister told him on the kingsroad, and in his mind\\'s eye he saw Ben Stark lying dead, his blood red on \\nthe snow. The thought made him sick. What was he becoming? \\nAfterward he sought out Ghost in the loneliness of his cell, and buried his face in his thick white fur. \\nIf he must be alone, he would make solitude his armor. Castle Black had no godswood, only a small \\nsept and a drunken septon, but Jon could not find it in him to pray to any gods, old or new. If they were \\nreal, he thought, they were as cruel and implacable as winter. \\nHe missed his true brothers: little Rickon, bright eyes shining as he begged for a sweet; Robb, his rival \\nand best friend and constant companion; Bran, stubborn and curious, always wanting to follow and join \\nin whatever Jon and Robb were doing. He missed the girls too, even Sansa, who never called him \\nanything but \"my half brother\" since she was old enough to understand what bastard meant. And Arya . . \\n. he missed her even more than Robb, skinny little thing that she was, all scraped knees and tangled hair \\nand torn clothes, so fierce and willful. Arya never seemed to fit, no more than he had . . . yet she could \\nalways make Jon smile. He would give anything to be with her now, to muss up her hair once more and \\nwatch her make a face, to hear her finish a sentence with him. \\n\"You broke my wrist, bastard boy.\" \\nJon lifted his eyes at the sullen voice. Grenn loomed over him, thick of neck and red of face, with three \\nof his friends behind him. He knew Todder, a short ugly boy with an unpleasant voice. The recruits all \\ncalled him Toad. The other two were the ones Yoren had brought north with them, Jon remembered, \\nrapers taken down in the Fingers. He\\'d forgotten their names. He hardly ever spoke ,to them, if he could \\nhelp it. They were brutes and bullies, without a thimble of honor between them. \\nJon stood up. \"I\\'ll break the other one for you if you ask nicely.\" Grenn was sixteen and a head taller \\nthan Jon. All four of them were bigger than he was, but they did not scare him. He\\'d beaten every one of \\nthem in the yard. \\n  119\\n\\n\"Maybe we\\'ll break you,\" one of the rapers said. \\n\"Try.\" Jon reached back for his sword, but one of them grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back. \\n\"You make us look bad,\" complained Toad. \\n\"You looked bad before I ever met you,\" Jon told him. The boy who had his arm jerked upward on him, \\nhard. Pain lanced through him, but Jon would not cry out. \\nToad stepped close. \"The little lordling has a mouth on him,\" he said. He had pig eyes, small and shiny. \\n\"Is that your mommy\\'s mouth, bastard? What was she, some whore? Tell us her name. Maybe I had her \\na time or two.\" He laughed. \\nJon twisted like an eel and slammed a heel down across the instep of the boy holding him. There was a \\nsudden cry of pain, and he was free. He flew at Toad, knocked him backward over a bench, and landed \\non his chest with both hands on his throat, slamming his head against the packed earth. \\nThe two from the Fingers pulled him off, throwing him roughly to the ground. Grenn began to kick at \\nhim. Jon was rolling away from the blows when a booming voice cut through the gloom of the armory. \\n\"STOP THIS! NOW!\" \\nJon pulled himself to his feet. Donal Noye stood glowering at them. \"The yard is for fighting,\" the \\narmorer said. \"Keep your quarrels out of my armory, or I\\'ll make them my quarrels. You won\\'t like that.\" \\nToad sat on the floor, gingerly feeling the back of his head. His fingers came away bloody. \"He tried to \\nkill me.\" \\n\" \\'S true. I saw it,\" one of the rapers put in. \\n\"He broke my wrist,\" Grenn said again, holding it out to Noye for inspection. \\nThe armorer gave the offered wrist the briefest of glances. \"A bruise. Perhaps a sprain. Maestor Aemon \\nwill give you a salve. Go with him, Todder, that head wants looking after. The rest of you, return to your \\ncells. Not you, Snow. You stay.\" \\nJon sat heavily on the long wooden bench as the others left, oblivious to the looks they gave him, the \\nsilent promises of future retribution. His arm was throbbing. \\n\"The Watch has need of every man it can get,\" Donal Noye said when they were alone. \"Even men like \\nToad. You won\\'t win any honors killing him.\" \\nJon\\'s anger flared. \"He said my mother was-\" \\n11 \\n-a whore. I heard him. What of it?\" \\n\"Lord Eddard Stark was not a man to sleep with whores,\" Jon said icily. \"His honor-\" \\n  120\\n\\n\"-did not prevent him from fathering a bastard. Did it?\" \\nJon was cold with rage. \"Can I go?\" \\n\"You go when I tell you to go.\" \\nJon stared sullenly at the smoke rising from the brazier, until Noye took him under the chin, thick fingers \\ntwisting his head around. \"Look at me when I\\'m talking to you, boy.\" \\nJon looked. The armorer had a chest like a keg of ale and a gut to match. His nose was flat and broad, \\nand he always seemed in need of a shave. The left sleeve of his black wool tunic was fastened at the \\nshoulder with a silver pin in the shape of a longsword. \"Words won\\'t make your mother a whore. She \\nwas what she was, and nothing Toad \\nsays can change that. You know, we have men on the Wall whose mothers were whores.\" \\nNot my mother, Jon thought stubbornly. He knew nothing of his mother; Eddard Stark would not talk of \\nher. Yet he dreamed of her at times, so often that he could almost see her face. In his dreams, she was \\nbeautiful, and highborn, and her eyes were kind. \\n\"You think you had it hard, being a high lord\\'s bastard?\" the armorer went on. \"That boy Jeren is a \\nsepton\\'s get, and Cotter Pyke is the baseborn son of a tavern wench. Now he commands Eastwatch by \\nthe Sea.\" \\n\"I don\\'t care,\" Jon said. \"I don\\'t care about them and I don\\'t care about you or Thorne or Benjen Stark \\nor any of it. I hate it here. It\\'s too . . . it\\'s cold.\" \\n\"Yes. Cold and hard and mean, that\\'s the Wall, and the men who walk it. Not like the stories your wet \\nnurse told you. Well, piss on the stories and piss on your wet nurse. This is the way it is, and you\\'re here \\nfor life, same as the rest of us.\" \\n\"Life,\" Jon repeated bitterly. The armorer could talk about life. He\\'d had one. He\\'d only taken the black \\nafter he\\'d lost an arm at the siege of Storm\\'s End. Before that he\\'d smithed for Stannis Baratheon, the \\nking\\'s brother. He\\'d seen the Seven Kingdoms from one end to the other; he\\'d feasted and wenched and \\nfought in a hundred battles. They said it was Donal Noye who\\'d forged King Robert\\'s warhammer, the \\none that crushed the life from Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident. He\\'d done all the things that Jon would \\nnever do, and then when he was old, well past thirty, he\\'d taken a glancing blow from an axe and the \\nwound had festered until the whole arm had to come off. Only then, crippled, had Donal Noye come to \\nthe Wall, when his life was all but over. \\n\"Yes, life,\" Noye said. \"A long life or a short one, it\\'s up to you, Snow. The road you\\'re walking, one of \\nyour brothers will slit your throat for you one night.\" \\n\"They\\'re not my brothers,\" Jon snapped. \"They hate me because I\\'m better than they are.\" \\n\"No. They hate you because you act like you\\'re better than they are. They look at you and see a \\ncastle-bred bastard who thinks he\\'s a lordling.\" The armorer leaned close. \"You\\'re no lordling. \\nRemember that. You\\'re a Snow, not a Stark. You\\'re a bastard and a bully.\" \\n  121\\n\\n\"A bully?\" Jon almost choked on the word. The accusation was so unjust it took his breath away. \"They \\nwere the ones who came after me. Four of them.\" \\n\"Four that you\\'ve humiliated in the yard. Four who are probably afraid of you. I\\'ve watched you fight. \\nIt\\'s not training with you. Put a \\ngood edge on your sword, and they\\'d be dead meat; you know it, I know it, they know it. You leave \\nthem nothing. You shame them. Does that make you proud?\" \\nJon hesitated. He did feel proud when he won. Why shouldn\\'t he? But the armorer was taking that away \\ntoo, making it sound as if he were doing something wrong. \"They\\'re all older than me,\" he said \\ndefensively. \\n\"Older and bigger and stronger, that\\'s the truth. I\\'ll wager your master-at-arms taught you how to fight \\nbigger men at Winterfell, though. Who was he, some old knight?\" \\n\"Ser Rodrik Cassel,\" Jon said warily. There was a trap here. He felt it closing around him. \\nDonal Noye leaned forward, into Jon\\'s face. \"Now think on this, boy. None of these others have ever \\nhad a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser. Their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers, smiths \\nand miners and oars on a trading galley. What they know of fighting they learned between decks, in the \\nalleys of Oldtown and Lannisport, in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad. They may have \\nclacked a few sticks together before they came here, but I promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich \\nenough to own a real sword.\" His look was grim. \"So how do you like the taste of your victories now, \\nLord Snow?\" \\n\"Don\\'t call me that!\" Jon said sharply, but the force had gone out of his anger. Suddenly he felt ashamed \\nand guilty. \"I never . . . I didn\\'t think . . .\" \\n\"Best you start thinking,\" Noye warned him. \"That, or sleep with a dagger by your bed. Now go.\" \\nBy the time Jon left the armory, it was almost midday. The sun had broken through the clouds. He \\nturned his back on it and lifted his eyes to the Wall, blazing blue and crystalline in the sunlight. Even after \\nall these weeks, the sight of it still gave him the shivers. Centuries of windblown dirt had pocked and \\nscoured it, covering it like a film, and it often seemed a pale grey, the color of an overcast sky . . . but \\nwhen the sun caught it fair on a bright day, it shone, alive with light, a colossal blue-white cliff that filled up \\nhalf the sky. \\nThe largest structure ever built by the hands of man, Benjen Stark had told Jon on the kingsroad when \\nthey had first caught sight of the Wall in the distance. \"And beyond a doubt the most useless,\" Tyrion \\nLannister had added with a grin, but even the Imp grew silent as they rode closer. You could see it from \\nmiles off, a pale blue line across the northern horizon, stretching away to the east and west and vanishing \\nin \\nthe far distance, immense and unbroken. This is the end of the world, it seemed to say. \\nWhen they finally spied Castle Black, its timbered keeps and stone towers looked like nothing more than \\n  122\\n\\na handful of toy blocks scattered on the snow, beneath the vast wall of ice. The ancient stronghold of the \\nblack brothers was no Winterfell, no true castle at all. Lacking walls, it could not be defended, not from \\nthe south, or east, or west; but it was only the north that concerned the Night\\'s Watch, and to the north \\nloomed the Wall. Almost seven hundred feet high it stood, three times the height of the tallest tower in the \\nstronghold it sheltered. His uncle said the top was wide enough for a dozen armored knights to ride \\nabreast. The gaunt outlines of huge catapults and monstrous wooden cranes stood sentry up there, like \\nthe skeletons of great birds, and among them walked men in black as small as ants. \\nAs he stood outside the armory looking up, Jon felt almost as overwhelmed as he had that day on the \\nkingsroad, when he\\'d seen it for the first time. The Wall was like that. Sometimes he could almost forget \\nthat it was there, the way you forgot about the sky or the earth underfoot, but there were other times \\nwhen it seemed as if there was nothing else in the world. It was older than the Seven Kingdoms, and \\nwhen he stood beneath it and looked up, it made Jon dizzy. He could feel the great weight of all that ice \\npressing down on him, as if it were about to topple, and somehow Jon knew that if it fell, the world fell \\nwith it. \\n\"Makes you wonder what lies beyond,\" a familiar voice said. \\nJon looked around. \"Lannister. I didn\\'t see-I mean, I thought I was alone.\" \\nTyrion Lannister was bundled in furs so thickly he looked like a very small bear. \"There\\'s much to be \\nsaid for taking people unawares. You never know what you might learn.\" \\n\"You won\\'t learn anything from me,\" Jon told him. He had seen little of the dwarf since their journey \\nended. As the queen\\'s own brother, Tyrion Lannister had been an honored guest of the Night\\'s Watch. \\nThe Lord Commander had given him rooms in the King\\'s Tower-so-called, though no king had visited it \\nfor a hundred yearsand Lannister dined at Mormont\\'s own table and spent his days riding the Wall and \\nhis nights dicing and drinking with Ser Alliser and Bowen Marsh and the other high officers. \\n\"Oh, I learn things everywhere I go.\" The little man gestured up at the Wall with a gnarled black walking \\nstick. \"As I was saying . . . why is it that when one man builds a wall, the next man immediately needs to \\nknow what\\'s on the other side?\" He cocked his head and looked at \\nJon with his curious mismatched eyes. \"You do want to know what\\'s on the other side, don\\'t you?\" \\n\"It\\'s nothing special,\" Jon said. He wanted to ride with Benjen Stark on his rangings, deep into the \\nmysteries of the haunted forest, wanted to fight Mance Rayder\\'s wildlings and ward the realm against the \\nOthers, but it was better not to speak of the things you wanted. \"The rangers say it\\'s just woods and \\nmountains and frozen lakes, with lots of snow and ice.\" \\n\"And the grumkins and the snarks,\" Tyrion said. \"Let us not forget them, Lord Snow, or else what\\'s that \\nbig thing for?\" \\n\"Don\\'t call me Lord Snow.\" \\nThe dwarf lifted an eyebrow. \"Would you rather be called the Imp? Let them see that their words can \\ncut you, and you\\'ll never be free of the mockery. If they want to give you a name, take it, make it your \\nown. Then they can\\'t hurt you with it anymore.\" He gestured with his stick. \"Come, walk with me. They\\'ll \\nbe serving some vile stew in the common hall by now, and I could do with a bowl of something hot.\" \\n  123\\n\\nJon was hungry too, so he fell in beside Lannister and slowed his pace to match the dwarf\\'s awkward, \\nwaddling steps. The wind was rising, and they could hear the old wooden buildings creaking around \\nthem, and in the distance a heavy shutter banging, over and over, forgotten. Once there was a muffled \\nthump as a blanket of snow slid from a roof and landed near them. \\n\"I don\\'t see your wolf,\" Lannister said as they walked. \\n\"I chain him up in the old stables when we\\'re training. They board all the horses in the east stables now, \\nso no one bothers him. The rest of the time he stays with me. My sleeping cell is in Hardin\\'s Tower.\" \\n\"That\\'s the one with the broken battlement, no? Shattered stone in the yard below, and a lean to it like \\nour noble king Robert after a long night\\'s drinking? I thought all those buildings had been abandoned.\" \\nJon shrugged. \"No one cares where you sleep. Most of the old keeps are empty, you can pick any cell \\nyou want.\" Once Castle Black had housed five thousand fighting men with all their horses and servants \\nand weapons. Now it was home to a tenth that number, and parts of it were falling into ruin. \\nTyrion Lannister\\'s laughter steamed in the cold air. \"I\\'ll be sure to tell your father to arrest more \\nstonemasons, before your tower collapses.\" \\nJon could taste the mockery there, but there was no denying the truth. The Watch had built nineteen \\ngreat strongholds along the Wall, but only three were still occupied: Eastwatch on its grey windswept \\nshore, the Shadow Tower hard by the mountains where the Wall \\nended, and Castle Black between them, at the end of the kingsroad. The other keeps, long deserted, \\nwere lonely, haunted places, where cold winds whistled through black windows and the spirits of the \\ndead manned the parapets. \\n\"It\\'s better that I\\'m by myself,\" Jon said stubbornly. \"The rest of them are scared of Ghost.\" \\n\"Wise boys,\" Lannister said. Then he changed the subject. \"The talk is, your uncle is too long away.\" \\nJon remembered the wish he\\'d wished in his anger, the vision of Benjen Stark dead in the snow, and he \\nlooked away quickly. The dwarf had a way of sensing things, and Jon did not want him to see the guilt in \\nhis eyes. \"He said he\\'d be back by my name day,\" he admitted. His name day had come and gone, \\nunremarked, a fortnight past. \"They were looking for Ser Waymar Royce, his father is bannerman to \\nLord Arryn. Uncle Benjen said they might search as far as the Shadow Tower. That\\'s all the way up in \\nthe mountains.\" \\n\"I hear that a good many rangers have vanished of late,\" Lannister said as they mounted the steps to the \\ncommon hall. He grinned and pulled open the door. \"Perhaps the grumkins are hungry this year.\" \\nInside, the hall was immense and drafty, even with a fire roaring in its great hearth. Crows nested in the \\ntimbers of its lofty ceiling. Jon heard their cries overhead as he accepted a bowl of stew and a heel of \\nblack bread from the day\\'s cooks. Grenn and Toad and some of the others were seated at the bench \\nnearest the warmth, laughing and cursing each other in rough voices. Jon eyed them thoughtfully for a \\nmoment. Then he chose a spot at the far end of the hall, well away from the other diners. \\n  124\\n\\nTyrion Lannister sat across from him, sniffing at the stew suspiciously. \"Barley, onion, carrot,\" he \\nmuttered. \"Someone should tell the cooks that turnip isn\\'t a meat.\" \\n\"It\\'s mutton stew.\" Jon pulled off his gloves and warmed his hands in the steam rising from the bowl. The \\nsmell made his mouth water. \\n\"Snow.\" \\nJon knew Alliser Thorne\\'s voice, but there was a curious note in it that he had not heard before. He \\nturned. \\n\"The Lord Commander wants to see you. Now.\" \\nFor a moment Jon was too frightened to move. Why would the Lord Commander want to see him? \\nThey had heard something about Benjen, he thought wildly, he was dead, the vision had come true. \"Is it \\nmy uncle?\" he blurted. \"Is he returned safe?\" \\n\"The Lord Commander is not accustomed to waiting,\" was Ser \\nAlliser\\'s reply. \"And I am not accustomed to having my commands questioned by bastards.\" \\nTyrion Lannister swung off the bench and rose. \"Stop it, Thorne. You\\'re frightening the boy.\" \\n\"Keep out of matters that don\\'t concern you, Lannister. You have no place here.\" \\n\"I have a place at court, though,\" the dwarf said, smiling. \"A word in the right ear, and you\\'ll die a sour \\nold man before you get another boy to train. Now tell Snow why the Old Bear needs to see him. Is there \\nnews of his uncle?\" \\n\"No,\" Ser Alliser said. \"This is another matter entirely. A bird arrived this morning from Winterfell, with a \\nmessage that concerns his brother.\" He corrected himself. \"His half brother.\" \\n\"Bran,\" Jon breathed, scrambling to his feet. \"Something\\'s happened to Bran.\" \\nTyrion Lannister laid a hand on his arm. \"Jon,\" he said. \"I am truly sorry.\" \\nJon scarcely heard him. He brushed off Tyrion\\'s hand and strode across the hall. He was running by the \\ntime he hit the doors. He raced to the Commander\\'s Keep, dashing through drifts of old snow. When the \\nguards passed him, he took the tower steps two at a time. By the time he burst into the presence of the \\nLord Commander, his boots were soaked and Jon was wild-eyed and panting. \"Bran,\" he said. \"What \\ndoes it say about Bran?\" \\nJeor Mormont, Lord Commander of the Night\\'s Watch, was a gruff old man with an immense bald head \\nand a shaggy grey beard. He had a raven on his arm, and he was feeding it kernels of corn. \"I am told \\nyou can read.\" He shook the raven off, and it flapped its wings and flew to the window, where it sat \\nwatching as Mormont drew a roll of paper from his belt and handed it to Jon. \"Com, \" it muttered in a \\nraucous voice. \"Com, com. \" \\nJon\\'s finger traced the outline of the direwolf in the white wax of the broken seat. He recognized Robb\\'s \\n  125\\n\\nhand, but the letters seemed to blur and run as he tried to read them. He realized he was crying. And \\nthen, through the tears, he found the sense in the words, and raised his head. \"He woke up,\" he said. \\n\"The gods gave him back.\" \\n\"Crippled,\" Mormont said. \"I\\'m sorry, boy. Read the rest of the letter.\" \\nHe looked at the words, but they didn\\'t matter. Nothing mattered. Bran was going to live. \"My brother is \\ngoing to live,\" he told Mormont. The Lord Commander shook his head, gathered up a fistful of corn, and \\nwhistled. The raven flew to his shoulder, crying, \"Live! Live!\" \\nJon ran down the stairs, a smile on his face and Robb\\'s letter in his hand. \"My brother is going to live,\" \\nhe told the guards. They exchanged a look. He ran back to the common hall, where he found Tyrion \\nLannister just finishing his meal. He grabbed the little man under the arms, hoisted him up in the air, and \\nspun him around in a circle. \"Bran is going to live!\" he whooped. Lannister looked startled. Jon put him \\ndown and thrust the paper into his hands. \"Here, read it,\" he said. \\nOthers were gathering around and looking at him curiously. Jon noticed Grenn a few feet away. A thick \\nwoolen bandage was wrapped around one hand. He looked anxious and uncomfortable, not menacing at \\nall. Jon went to him. Grenn edged backward and put up his hands. \"Stay away from me now, you \\nbastard.\" \\nJon smiled at him. \"I\\'m sorry about your wrist. Robb used the same move on me once, only with a \\nwooden blade. It hurt like seven hells, but yours must be worse. Look, if you want, I can show you how \\nto defend that.\" \\nAlliser Thorne overheard him. \"Lord Snow wants to take my place now.\" He sneered. \"I\\'d have an \\neasier time teaching a wolf to juggle than you will training this aurochs.\" \\n\"I\\'ll take that wager, Ser Alliser,\" Jon said. \"I\\'d love to see Ghost juggle.\" \\nJon heard Grenn suck in his breath, shocked. Silence fell. \\nThen Tyrion Lannister guffawed. Three of the black brothers joined in from a nearby table. The laughter \\nspread up and down the benches, until even the cooks joined in. The birds stirred in the rafters, and \\nfinally even Grenn began to chuckle. \\nSer Alliser never took his eyes from Jon. As the laughter rolled around him, his face darkened, and his \\nsword hand curled into a fist. \"That was a grievous error, Lord Snow,\" he said at last in the acid tones of \\nan enemy. \\nEDDARD \\nEddard Stark rode through the towering bronze doors of the Red Keep sore, tired, hungry, and irritable. \\nHe was still a horse, dreaming of a long hot soak, a roast fowl, and a featherbed, when the king\\'s \\nsteward told him that Grand Maester Pycelle had convened an urgent meeting of the small council. The \\nhonor of the Hand\\'s presence was requested as soon as it was convenient. \"It will be convenient on the \\nmorrow,\" Ned snapped as he dismounted. \\n  126\\n\\nThe steward bowed very low. \"I shall give the councillors your regrets, my lord.\" \\n\"No, damn it,\" Ned said. It would not do to offend the council before he had even begun. \"I will see \\nthem. Pray give me a few moments to change into something more presentable.\" \\n\"Yes, my lord,\" the steward said. \"We have given you Lord Arryn\\'s former chambers in the Tower of \\nthe Hand, if it please you. I shall have your things taken there.\" \\n\"My thanks,\" Ned said as he ripped off his riding gloves and tucked them into his belt. The rest of his \\nhousehold was coming through the gate behind him. Ned saw Vayon Poole, his own steward, and called \\nout. \"It seems the council has urgent need of me. See that my daughters find their bedchambers, and tell \\nJory to keep them there. Arya is not to go exploring.\" Poole bowed. Ned turned back to the royal \\nsteward. \"My wagons are still straggling through the city. I shall need appropriate garments.\" \\n\"It will be my great pleasure,\" the steward said. \\nAnd so Ned had come striding into the council chambers, bonetired and dressed in borrowed clothing, \\nto find four members of the small council waiting for him. \\nThe chamber was richly furnished. Myrish carpets covered the floor instead of rushes, and in one corner \\na hundred fabulous beasts cavorted in bright paints on a carved screen from the Summer Isles. The walls \\nwere hung with tapestries from Norvos and Qohor and Lys, and a pair of Valyrian sphinxes flanked the \\ndoor, eyes of polished garnet smoldering in black marble faces. \\nThe councillor Ned liked least, the eunuch Varys, accosted him the moment he entered. \"Lord Stark, I \\nwas grievous sad to hear about your troubles on the kingsroad. We have all been visiting the sept to light \\ncandles for Prince Joffrey. I pray for his recovery.\" His hand left powder stains on Ned\\'s sleeve, and he \\nsmelled as foul and sweet as flowers on a grave. \\n\"Your gods have heard you,\" Ned replied, cool yet polite. \"The prince grows stronger every day.\" He \\ndisentangled himself from the eunuch\\'s grip and crossed the room to where Lord Renly stood by the \\nscreen, talking quietly with a short man who could only be Littlefinger. Renly had been a boy of eight \\nwhen Robert won the throne, but he had grown into a man so like his brother that Ned found it \\ndisconcerting. Whenever he saw him, it was as if the years had slipped away and Robert stood before \\nhim, fresh from his victory on the Trident. \\n\"I see you have arrived safely, Lord Stark,\" Renly said. \\n\"And you as well,\" Ned replied. \"You must forgive me, but sometimes you look the very image of your \\nbrother Robert.\" \\n\"A poor copy,\" Renly said with a shrug. \\n\"Though much better dressed,\" Littlefinger quipped. \"Lord Renly spends more on clothing than half the \\nladies of the court.\" \\nIt was true enough. Lord Renly was in dark green velvet, with a dozen golden stags embroidered on his \\n  127\\n\\ndoublet. A cloth-of-gold half cape was draped casually across one shoulder, fastened with an emerald \\nbrooch. \"There are worse crimes,\" Renly said with a laugh. \"The wayyou dress, for one.\" \\nLittlefinger ignored the jibe. He eyed Ned with a smile on his lips that bordered on insolence. \"I have \\nhoped to meet you for some years, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me to you.\" \\n\"She has,\" Ned replied with a chill in his voice. The sly arrogance of \\nthe comment rankled him. \"I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.\" \\nRenly Baratheon laughed. Varys shuffled over to listen. \\n\"Rather too well,\" Littlefinger said. \"I still carry a token of his esteem. Did Brandon speak of me too?\" \\n\"Often, and with some heat,\" Ned said, hoping that would end it. He had no patience with this game they \\nplayed, this dueling with words. \\n\"I should have thought that heat ill suits you Starks,\" Littlefinger said. \"Here in the south, they say you are \\nall made of ice, and melt when you ride below the Neck.\" \\n\"I do not plan on melting soon, Lord Baelish. You may count on it.\" Ned moved to the council table and \\nsaid, \"Maester Pycelle, I trust you are well.\" \\nThe Grand Maester smiled gently from his tall chair at the foot of the table. \"Well enough for a man of \\nmy years, my lord,\" he replied, \"yet I do tire easily, I fear.\" Wispy strands of white hair fringed the broad \\nbald dome of his forehead above a kindly face. His maester\\'s collar was no simple metal choker such as \\nLuwin wore, but two dozen heavy chains wound together into a ponderous metal necklace that covered \\nhim from throat to breast. The links were forged of every metal known to man: black iron and red gold, \\nbright copper and dull lead, steel and tin and pale silver, brass and bronze and platinum. Garnets and \\namethysts and black pearls adorned the metalwork, and here and there an emerald or ruby. \"Perhaps we \\nmight begin soon,\" the Grand Maester said, hands knitting together atop his broad stomach. \"I fear I shall \\nfall asleep if we wait much longer.\" \\n\"As you will.\" The king\\'s seat sat empty at the head of the table, the crowned stag of Baratheon \\nembroidered in gold thread on its pillows. Ned took the chair beside it, as the right hand of his king. \"My \\nlords,\" he said formally, \"I am sorry to have kept you waiting.\" \\n\"You are the King\\'s Hand,\" Varys said. \"We serve at your pleasure, Lord Stark.\" \\nAs the others took their accustomed seats, it struck Eddard Stark forcefully that he did not belong here, \\nin this room, with these men. He remembered what Robert had told him in the crypts below Winterfell. I \\nam surrounded by flatterers andfools, the king had insisted. Ned looked down the council table and \\nwondered which were the flatterers and which the fools. He thought he knew already. \"We are but five,\" \\nhe pointed out. \\n\"Lord Stannis took himself to Dragonstone not long after the king went north,\" Varys said, \"and our \\ngallant Ser Barristan no doubt rides \\n  128\\n\\nbeside the king as he makes his way through the city, as befits the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.\" \\n\"Perhaps we had best wait for Ser Barristan and the king to join us,\" Ned suggested. \\nRenly Baratheon laughed aloud. \"If we wait for my brother to grace us with his royal presence, it could \\nbe a long sit.\" \\n\"Our good King Robert has many cares,\" Varys said. \"He entrusts some small matters to us, to lighten \\nhis load.\" \\n\"What Lord Varys means is that all this business of coin and crops and justice bores my royal brother to \\ntears,\" Lord Renly said, \"so it falls to us to govern the realm. He does send us a command from time to \\ntime.\" He drew a tightly rolled paper from his sleeve and laid it on the table. \"This morning he \\ncommanded me to ride ahead with all haste and ask Grand Maester Pycelle to convene this council at \\nonce. He has an urgent task for us.\" \\nLittlefinger smiled and handed the paper to Ned. It bore the royal seal. Ned broke the wax with his \\nthumb and flattened the letter to consider the king\\'s urgent command, reading the words with mounting \\ndisbelief. Was there no end to Robert\\'s folly? And to do this in his name, that was salt in the wound. \\n\"Gods be good,\" he swore. \\n\"What Lord Eddard means to say,\" Lord Renly announced, \"is that His Grace instructs us to stage a \\ngreat tournament in honor of his appointment as the Hand of the King.\" \\n\"How much?\" asked Littlefinger, mildly. \\nNed read the answer off the letter. \"Forty thousand golden dragons to the champion. Twenty thousand \\nto the man who comes second, another twenty to the winner of the melee, and ten thousand to the victor \\nof the archery competition.\" \\n\"Ninety thousand gold pieces,\" Littlefinger sighed. \"And we must not neglect the other costs. Robert will \\nwant a prodigious feast. That means cooks, carpenters, serving girls, singers, jugglers, fools \\n\"Fools we have in plenty,\" Lord Renly said. \\nGrand Maester Pycelle looked to Littlefinger and asked, \"Will the treasury bear the expense?\" \\n\"What treasury is that?\" Littlefinger replied with a twist of his mouth. \"Spare me the foolishness, Maester. \\nYou know as well as I that the treasury has been empty for years. I shall have to borrow the money. No \\ndoubt the Lannisters will be accommodating. We owe Lord Tywin some three million dragons at present, \\nwhat matter another hundred thousand?\" \\nNed was stunned. \"Are you claiming that the Crown is three million gold pieces in debt?\" \\n\"The Crown is more than six million gold pieces in debt, Lord Stark. The Lannisters are the biggest part \\nof it, but we have also borrowed from Lord Tyrell, the Iron Bank of Braavos, and several Tyroshi trading \\ncartels. Of late I\\'ve had to turn to the Faith. The High Septon haggles worse than a Dornish fishmonger.\" \\n  129\\n\\nNed was aghast. \"Aerys Targaryen left a treasury flowing with gold. How could you let this happen?\" \\nLittlefinger gave a shrug. \"The master of coin finds the money. The king and the Hand spend it.\" \\n\"I will not believe that Jon Arryn allowed Robert to beggar the realm,\" Ned said hotly. \\nGrand Maester Pycelle shook his great bald head, his chains clinking softly. \"Lord Arryn was a prudent \\nman, but I fear that His Grace does not always listen to wise counsel.\" \\n\"My royal brother loves tournaments and feasts,\" Renly Baratheon said, \"and he loathes what he calls \\n\\'counting coppers.\\' \" \\n\"I will speak with His Grace,\" Ned said. \"This tourney is an extravagance the realm cannot afford.\" \\n\"Speak to him as you will,\" Lord Renly said, \"we had still best make our plans.\" \\n\"Another day,\" Ned said. Perhaps too sharply, from the looks they gave him. He would have to \\nremember that he was no longer in Winterfell, where only the king stood higher; here, he was but first \\namong equals. \"Forgive me, my lords,\" he said in a softer tone. \"I am tired. Let us call a halt for today \\nand resume when we are fresher.\" He did not ask for their consent, but stood abruptly, nodded at them \\nall, and made for the door. \\nOutside, wagons and riders were still pouring through the castle gates, and the yard was a chaos of mud \\nand horseflesh and shouting men. The king had not yet arrived, he was told. Since the ugliness on the \\nTrident, the Starks and their household had ridden well ahead of the main column, the better to separate \\nthemselves from the Lannisters and the growing tension. Robert had hardly been seen; the talk was he \\nwas traveling in the huge wheelhouse, drunk as often as not. If so, he might be hours behind, but he \\nwould still be here too soon for Ned\\'s liking. He had only to look at Sansa\\'s face to feel the rage twisting \\ninside him once again. The last fortnight of their journey had been a misery. Sansa blamed Arya and told \\nher that it should have been Nymeria who died. And Arya was lost after she heard what had happened \\nto her butcher\\'s boy. Sansa cried herself to sleep, Arya brooded silently all day long, and Eddard Stark \\ndreamed of a frozen hell reserved for the Starks of Winterfell. \\nHe crossed the outer yard, passed under a portcullis into the inner bailey, and was walking toward what \\nhe thought was the Tower of the Hand when Littlefinger appeared in front of him. \"You\\'re going the \\nwrong way, Stark. Come with me.\" \\nHesitantly, Ned followed. Littlefinger led him into a tower, down a stair, across a small sunken \\ncourtyard, and along a deserted corridor where empty suits of armor stood sentinel along the walls. They \\nwere relics of the Targaryens, black steel with dragon scales cresting their helms, now dusty and \\nforgotten. \"This is not the way to my chambers,\" Ned said. \\n\"Did I say it was? I\\'m leading you to the dungeons to slit your throat and seal your corpse up behind a \\nwall,\" Littlefinger replied, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \"We have no time for this, Stark. Your wife \\nawaits.\" \\n\"What game are you playing, Littlefinger? Catelyn is at Winterfell, hundreds of leagues from here.\" \\n\"Oh?\" Littlefinger\\'s grey-green eyes glittered with amusement. \"Then it appears someone has managed \\n  130\\n\\nan astonishing impersonation. For the last time, come. Or don\\'t come, and I\\'ll keep her for myself.\" He \\nhurried down the steps. \\nNed followed him warily, wondering if this day would ever end. He had no taste for these intrigues, but \\nhe was beginning to realize that they were meat and mead to a man like Littlefinger. \\nAt the foot of the steps was a heavy door of oak and iron. Petyr Baelish lifted the crossbar and gestured \\nNed through. They stepped out into the ruddy glow of dusk, on a rocky bluff high above the river. \\n\"We\\'re outside the castle,\" Ned said. \\n\"You are a hard man to fool, Stark,\" Littlefinger said with a smirk. \"Was it the sun that gave it away, or \\nthe sky? Follow me. There are niches cut in the rock. Try not to fall to your death, Catelyn would never \\nunderstand.\" With that, he was over the side of the cliff, descending as quick as a monkey. \\nNed studied the rocky face of the bluff for a moment, then followed more slowly. The niches were there, \\nas Littlefinger had promised, shallow cuts that would be invisible from below, unless you knew just where \\nto look for them. The river was a long, dizzying distance below. Ned kept his face pressed to the rock \\nand tried not to look down any more often than he had to. \\nWhen at last he reached the bottom, a narrow, muddy trail along the water\\'s edge, Littlefinger was lazing \\nagainst a rock and eating an apple. He was almost down to the core. \"You are growing old and slow, \\nStark,\" he said, flipping the apple casually into the rushing water. \\nA GAME, OF THRONLS 175 \\n\"No matter, we ride the rest of the way.\" He had two horses waiting. Ned mounted up and trotted \\nbehind him, down the trail and into the city. \\nFinally Baelish drew rein in front of a ramshackle building, three stories, timbered, its windows bright \\nwith lamplight in the gathering dusk. The sounds of music and raucous laughter drifted out and floated \\nover the water. Beside the door swung an ornate oil lamp on a heavy chain, with a globe of leaded red \\nglass. \\nNed Stark dismounted in a fury. \"A brothel,\" he said as he seized Littlefinger by the shoulder and spun \\nhim around. \"You\\'ve brought me all this way to take me to a brothel.\" \\n\"Your wife is inside,\" Littlefinger said. \\nIt was the final insult. \"Brandon was too kind to you,\" Ned said as he slammed the small man back \\nagainst a wall and shoved his dagger up under the little pointed chin beard. \\n\"My lord, no,\" an urgent voice called out. \"He speaks the truth.\" There were footsteps behind him. \\nNed spun, knife in hand, as an old white-haired man hurried toward them. He was dressed in brown \\nroughspun, and the soft flesh under his chin wobbled as he ran. \"This is no business of yours,\" Ned \\nbegan; then, suddenly, the recognition came. He lowered the dagger, astonished. \"Ser Rodfik?\" \\nRodrik Cassel nodded. \"Your lady awaits you upstairs.\" \\nNed was lost. \"Catelyn is truly here? This is not some strange jape of Littlefinger\\'s?\" He sheathed his \\nblade. \\n  131\\n\\n\"Would that it were, Stark,\" Littlefinger said. \"Follow me, and try to look a shade more lecherous and a \\nshade less like the King\\'s Hand. It would not do to have you recognized. Perhaps you could fondle a \\nbreast or two, just in passing.\" \\nThey went inside, through a crowded common room where a fat woman was singing bawdy songs while \\npretty young girls in linen shifts and wisps of colored silk pressed themselves against their lovers and \\ndandled on their laps. No one paid Ned the least bit of attention. Ser Rodrik waited below while \\nLittlefinger led him up to the third floor, along a corridor, and through a door. \\nInside, Catelyn was waiting. She cried out when she saw him, ran to him, and embraced him fiercely. \\n\"My lady,\" Ned whispered in wonderment. \\n\"Oh, very good,\" said Littlefinger, closing the door. \"You recognized her.\" \\n\"I feared you\\'d never come, my lord,\" she whispered against his \\nchest. \"Petyr has been bringing me reports. He told me of your troubles with Arya and the young prince. \\nHow are my girls?\" \\n\"Both in mourning, and full of anger,\" he told her. \"Cat, I do not understand. What are you doing in \\nKing\\'s Landing? What\\'s happened?\" Ned asked his wife. \"Is it Bran? Is he . . .\" Dead was the word that \\ncame to his lips, but he could not say it. \\n\"It is Bran, but not as you think,\" Catelyn said. \\nNed was lost. \"Then how? Why are you here, my love? What is this place?\" \\n\"Just what it appears,\" Littlefinger said, easing himself onto a window seat. \"A brothel. Can you think of \\na less likely place to find a Catelyn Tully?\" He smiled. \"As it chances, I own this particular establishment, \\nso arrangements were easily made. I am most anxious to keep the Lannisters from learning that Cat is \\nhere in King\\'s Landing.\" \\n\"Why?\" Ned asked. He saw her hands then, the awkward way she held them, the raw red scars, the \\nstiffness of the last two fingers on her left. \"You\\'ve been hurt.\" He took her hands in his own, turned them \\nover. \"Gods. Those are deep cuts . . . a gash from a sword or . . . how did this happen, my lady?\" \\nCatelyn slid a dagger out from under her cloak and placed it in his hand. \"This blade was sent to open \\nBran\\'s throat and spill his life\\'s blood.\" \\nNed\\'s head jerked up. \"But . . . who . . . why would \\nShe put a finger to his lips. \"Let me tell it all, my love. It will go faster that way. Listen.\" \\nSo he listened, and she told it all, from the fire in the library tower to Varys and the guardsmen and \\nLittlefinger. And when she was done, Eddard Stark sat dazed beside the table, the dagger in his hand. \\nBran\\'s wolf had saved the boy\\'s life, he thought dully. What was it that Jon had said when they found the \\npups in the snow? Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord. And he had killed Sansa\\'s, and \\n  132\\n\\nfor what? Was it guilt he was feeling? Or fear? If the gods had sent these wolves, what folly had he \\ndone? \\nPainfully, Ned forced his thoughts back to the dagger and what it meant. \"The Imp\\'s dagger,\" he \\nrepeated. It made no sense. His hand curled around the smooth dragonbone hilt, and he slammed the \\nblade into the table, felt it bite into the wood. It stood mocking him. \"Why should Tyrion Lannister want \\nBran dead? The boy has never done him harm.\" \\n\"Do you Starks have nought but snow between your ears?\" Littlefinger asked. \"The Imp would never \\nhave acted alone.\" \\nNed rose and paced the length of the room. \"If the queen had a role \\nin this or, gods forbid, the king himself ... no, I will not believe that.\" Yet even as he said the words, he \\nremembered that chill morning on the barrowlands, and Robert\\'s talk of sending hired knives after the \\nTargaryen princess. He remembered Rhaegar\\'s infant son, the red ruin of his skull, and the way the king \\nhad turned away, as he had turned away in Darry\\'s audience hall not so long ago. He could still hear \\nSansa pleading, as Lyanna had pleaded once. \\n\"Most likely the king did not know,\" Littlefinger said. \"It would not be the first time. Our good Robert is \\npracticed at closing his eyes to things he would rather not see.\" \\nNed had no reply for that. The face of the butcher\\'s boy swam up before his eyes, cloven almost in two, \\nand afterward the king had said not a word. His head was pounding. \\nLittlefinger sauntered over to the table, wrenched the knife from the wood. \"The accusation is treason \\neither way. Accuse the king and you will dance with Ilyn Payne before the words are out of your mouth. \\nThe queen . . . if you can find proof, and if you can make Robert listen, then perhaps . . . \\n\"We have proof,\" Ned said. \"We have the dagger.\" \\n\"This?\" Littlefinger flipped the knife casually end over end. \"A sweet piece of steel, but it cuts two ways, \\nmy lord. The Imp will no doubt swear the blade was lost or stolen while he was at Winterfell, and with \\nhis hireling dead, who is there to give him the lie?\" He tossed the knife lightly to Ned. \"My counsel is to \\ndrop that in the river and forget that it was ever forged.\" \\nNed regarded him coldly. \"Lord Baelish, I am a Stark of Winterfell. My son lies crippled, perhaps dying. \\nHe would be dead, and Catelyn with him, but for a wolf pup we found in the snow. If you truly believe I \\ncould forget that, you are as big a fool now as when you took up sword against my brother.\" \\n\"A fool I may be, Stark . . . yet I\\'m still here, while your brother has been moldering in his frozen grave \\nfor some fourteen years now. If you are so eager to molder beside him, far be it from me to dissuade \\nyou, but I would rather not be included in the party, thank you very much.\" \\n\"You would be the last man I would willingly include in any party, Lord Baelish.\" \\n\"You wound me deeply.\" Littlefinger placed a hand over his heart. \"For my part, I always found you \\nStarks a tiresome lot, but Cat seems to have become attached to you, for reasons I cannot comprehend. \\nI shall try to keep you alive for her sake. A fool\\'s task, admittedly, but I could never refuse your wife \\n  133\\n\\nanything.\" \\nLittlefinger. \"I should warn you, Stark, we usually charge for that sort of thing around here.\" \\n\"A moment alone, that\\'s all I ask,\" Catelyn said. \\n\"Very well.\" Littlefinger strolled to the door. \"Don\\'t be too long. It is past time the Hand and I returned \\nto the castle, before our absence is noted.\" \\nCatelyn went to him and took his hands in her own. \"I will not forget the help you gave me, Petyr. When \\nyour men came for me, I did not know whether they were taking me to a friend or an enemy. I have \\nfound you more than a friend. I have found a brother I\\'d thought lost.\" \\nPetyr Baelish smiled. \"I am desperately sentimental, sweet lady. Best not tell anyone. I have spent years \\nconvincing the court that I am wicked and cruel, and I should hate to see all that hard work go for \\nnaught.\" \\nNed believed not a word of that, but he kept his voice polite as he said, \"You have my thanks as well, \\nLord Baelish.\" \\n\"Oh, now there\\'s a treasure,\" Littlefinger said, exiting. \\nWhen the door had closed behind him, Ned turned back to his wife. \"Once you are home, send word to \\nHelman Tallhart and Galbart Glover under my seal. They are to raise a hundred bowmen each and fortify \\nMoat Cailin. Two hundred determined archers can hold the Neck against an army. Instruct Lord \\nManderly that he is to strengthen and repair all his defenses at White Harbor, and see that they are well \\nmanned. And from this day on, I want a careful watch kept over Theon Greyjoy. If there is war, we shall \\nhave sore need of his father\\'s fleet.\" \\n\"War?\" The fear was plain on Catelyn\\'s face. \\n\"It will not come to that,\" Ned promised her, praying it was true. He took her in his arms again. \"The \\nLannisters are merciless in the face of weakness, as Aerys Targaryen learned to his sorrow, but they \\nwould not dare attack the north without all the power of the realm behind them, and that they shall not \\nhave. I must play out this fool\\'s masquerade as if nothing is amiss. Remember why I came here, my love. \\nIf I find proof that the Lannisters murdered Jon Arryn . . . \\nHe felt Catelyn tremble in his arms. Her scarred hands clung to him. \"If,\" she said, \"what then, my love?\" \\nThat was the most dangerous part, Ned knew. \"All justice flows from the king,\" he told her. \"When I \\nknow the truth, I must go to Robert.\" And pray that he is the man I think he is, he finished silently, and \\nnot the man I fear he has become. \\nTYRION \\nAre you certain that you must leave us so soon?\" the Lord Commander asked him. \\n  134\\n\\n\"Past certain, Lord Mormont,\" Tyrion replied. \"My brother Jaime will be wondering what has become \\nof me. He may decide that you have convinced me to take the black.\" \\n\"Would that I could.\" Mormont picked up a crab claw and cracked it in his fist. Old as he was, the Lord \\nCommander still had the strength of a bear. \"You\\'re a cunning man, Tyrion. We have need of men of \\nyour sort on the Wall.\" \\nTyrion grinned. \"Then I shall scour the Seven Kingdoms for dwarfs and ship them all to you, Lord \\nMormont.\" As they laughed, he sucked the meat from a crab leg and reached for another. The crabs had \\narrived from Eastwatch only this morning, packed in a barrel of snow, and they were succulent. \\nSer Alliser Thorne was the only man at table who did not so much as crack a smile. \"Lannister mocks \\nus.\" \\n\"Only you, Ser Alliser,\" Tyrion said. This time the laughter round the table had a nervous, uncertain \\nquality to it. \\nThorne\\'s black eyes fixed on Tyrion with loathing. \"You have a bold tongue for someone who is less \\nthan half a man. Perhaps you and I should visit the yard together.\" \\n\"Why?\" asked Tyrion. \"The crabs are here.\" \\nThe remark brought more guffaws from the others. Ser Alliser stood up, his mouth a tight line. \"Come \\nand make your j apes with steel in your hand.\" \\nTyrion looked pointedly at his right hand. \"Why, I have steel in my hand, Ser Alliser, although it appears \\nto be a crab fork. Shall we duel?\" He hopped up on his chair and began poking at Thorne\\'s chest with \\nthe tiny fork. Roars of laughter filled the tower room. Bits of crab flew from the Lord Commander\\'s \\nmouth as he began to gasp and choke. Even his raven joined in, cawing loudly from above the window. \\n\"Duel! Duel! Duel!\" \\nSer Alliser Thorne walked from the room so stiffly it looked as though he had a dagger up his butt. \\nMormont was still gasping for breath. Tyrion pounded him on the back. \"To the victor goes the spoils,\" \\nhe called out. \"I claim Thorne\\'s share of the crabs.\" \\nFinally the Lord Commander recovered himself. \"You are a wicked man, to provoke our Ser Alliser so,\" \\nhe scolded. \\nTyrion seated himself and took a sip of wine. \"If a man paints a target on his chest, he should expect that \\nsooner or later someone will loose an arrow at him. I have seen dead men with more humor than your \\nSer Alliser.\" \\n\"Not so,\" objected the Lord Steward, Bowen Marsh, a man as round and red as a pomegranate. \"You \\nought to hear the droll names he gives the lads he trains.\" \\nTyrion had heard a few of those droll names. \"I\\'ll wager the lads have a few names for him as well,\" he \\nsaid. \"Chip the ice off your eyes, my good lords. Ser Alliser Thorne should be mucking out your stables, \\nnot drilling your young warriors.\" \\n  135\\n\\n\"The Watch has no shortage of stableboys,\" Lord Mormont grumbled. \"That seems to be all they send \\nus these days. Stableboys and sneak thieves and rapers. Ser Alliser is an anointed knight, one of the few \\nto take the black since I have been Lord Commander. He fought bravely at King\\'s Landing.\" \\n\"On the wrong side,\" Ser Jaremy Rykker commented dryly. \"I ought to know, I was there on the \\nbattlements beside him. Tywin Lannister gave us a splendid choice. Take the black, or see our heads on \\nspikes before evenfall. No offense intended, Tyrion.\" \\n\"None taken, Ser Jaremy. My father is very fond of spiked heads, especially those of people who have \\nannoyed him in some fashion. And a face as noble as yours, well, no doubt he saw you decorating the \\ncity wall above the King\\'s Gate. I think you would have looked very striking up there.\" \\n\"Thank you,\" Ser Jaremy replied with a sardonic smile. \\nLord Commander Mormont cleared his throat. \"Sometimes I fear Ser Alliser saw you true, Tyrion. You \\ndo mock us and our noble purpose here.\" \\nTyrion shrugged. \"We all need to be mocked from time to time, Lord Mormont, lest we start to take \\nourselves too seriously. More wine, please.\" He held out his cup. \\nAs Rykker filled it for him, Bowen Marsh said, \"You have a great thirst for a small man.\" \\n\"Oh, I think that Lord Tyrion is quite a large man,\" Maester Aemon said from the far end of the table. \\nHe spoke softly, yet the high officers of the Night\\'s Watch all fell quiet, the better to hear what the ancient \\nhad to say. \"I think he is a giant come among us, here at the end of the world.\" \\nTyrion answered gently, \"I\\'ve been called many things, my lord, but giant is seldom one of them.\" \\n\"Nonetheless,\" Maester Aemon said as his clouded, milk-white eyes moved to Tyrion\\'s face, \"I think it is \\ntrue.\" \\nFor once, Tyrion Lannister found himself at a loss for words. He could only bow his head politely and \\nsay, \"You are too kind, Maester Aemon.\" \\nThe blind man smiled. He was a tiny thing, wrinkled and hairless, shrunken beneath the weight of a \\nhundred years so his maester\\'s collar with its links of many metals hung loose about his throat. \"I have \\nbeen called many things, my lord,\" he said, \"but kind is seldom one of them.\" This time Tyrion himself led \\nthe laughter. \\nMuch later, when the serious business of eating was done and the others had left, Mormont offered \\nTyrion a chair beside the fire and a cup of mulled spirits so strong they brought tears to his eyes. \"The \\nkingsroad can be perilous this far north,\" the Lord Commander told him as they drank. \\n\"I have Jyck and Morrec,\" Tyrion said, \"and Yoren is riding south again.\" \\n\"Yoren is only one man. The Watch shall escort you as far as Winterfell,\" Mormont announced in a tone \\nthat brooked no argument. \"Three men should be sufficient.\" \\n  136\\n\\n\"If you insist, my lord,\" Tyrion said. \"You might send young Snow. He would be glad for a chance to see \\nhis brothers.\" \\nMormont frowned through his thick grey beard. \"Snow? Oh, the Stark bastard. I think not. The young \\nones need to forget the lives they left behind them, the brothers and mothers and all that. A visit home \\nwould only stir up feelings best left alone. I know these things. My own \\nblood kin ... my sister Maege rules Bear Island now, since my son\\'s dishonor. I have nieces I have never \\nseen.\" He took a swallow. \"Besides, Jon Snow is only a boy. You shall have three strong swords, to \\nkeep you safe.\" \\n\"I am touched by your concern, Lord Mormont.\" The strong drink was making Tyrion light-headed, but \\nnot so drunk that he did not realize that the Old Bear wanted something from him. \"I hope I can repay \\nyour kindness.\" \\n\"You can,\" Mormont said bluntly. \"Your sister sits beside the king. Your brother is a great knight, and \\nyour father the most powerful lord in the Seven Kingdoms. Speak to them for us. Tell them of our need \\nhere. You have seen for yourself, my lord. The Night\\'s Watch is dying. Our strength is less than a \\nthousand now. Six hundred here, two hundred in the Shadow Tower, even fewer at Eastwatch, and a \\nscant third of those fighting men. The Wall is a hundred leagues long. Think on that. Should an attack \\ncome, I have three men to defend each mile of wall.\" \\n\"Three and a third,\" Tyrion said with a yawn. \\nMormont scarcely seemed to hear him. The old man warmed his hands before the fire. \"I sent Benjen \\nStark to search after Yohn Royce\\'s son, lost on his first ranging. The Royce boy was green as summer \\ngrass, yet he insisted on the honor of his own command, saying it was his due as a knight. I did not wish \\nto offend his lord father, so I yielded. I sent him out with two men I deemed as good as any in the Watch. \\nMore fool U\\' \\n\"Fool, \" the raven agreed. Tyrion glanced up. The bird peered down at him with those beady black eyes, \\nruffling its wings. \"Fool, \" it called again. Doubtless old Mormont would take it amiss if he throttled the \\ncreature. A pity. \\nThe Lord Commander took no notice of the irritating bird. \"Gared was near as old as I am and longer \\non the Wall,\" he went on, \"yet it would seem he forswore himself and fled. I should never have believed \\nit, not of him, but Lord Eddard sent me his head from Winterfell. Of Royce, there is no word. One \\ndeserter and two men lost, and now Ben Stark too has gone missing.\" He sighed deeply. \"Who am I to \\nsend searching after him? In two years I will be seventy. Too old and too weary for the burden I bear, \\nyet if I set it down, who will pick it up? Alliser Thorne? Bowen Marsh? I would have to be as blind as \\nMaester Aemon not to see what they are. The Night\\'s Watch has become an army of sullen boys and \\ntired old men. Apart from the men at my table tonight, I have perhaps twenty who can read, and even \\nfewer who can think, or plan, or lead. Once the Watch spent its summers building, and \\neach Lord Commander raised the Wall higher than he found it. Now it is all we can do to stay alive.\" \\nHe was in deadly earnest, Tyrion realized. He felt faintly embarrassed for the old man. Lord Mormont \\n  137\\n\\nhad spent a good part of his life on the Wall, and he needed to believe if those years were to have any \\nmeaning. \"I promise, the king will hear of your need,\" Tyrion said gravely, \"and I will speak to my father \\nand my brother Jaime as well.\" And he would. Tyrion Lannister was as good as his word. He left the rest \\nunsaid; that King Robert would ignore him, Lord Tywin would ask if he had taken leave of his senses, \\nand Jaime would only laugh. \\n\"You are a young man, Tyrion,\" Mormont said. \"How many winters have you seen?\" \\nHe shrugged. \"Eight, nine. I misremember.\" \\n\"And all of them short.\" \\n\"As you say, my lord.\" He had been born in the dead of winter, a terrible cruel one that the maesters \\nsaid had lasted near three years, but Tyrion\\'s earliest memories were of spring. \\n\"When I was a boy, it was said that a long summer always meant a long winter to come. This summer \\nhas lasted nine years, Tyrion, and a tenth will soon be upon us. Think on that.\" \\n\"When I was a boy,\" Tyrion replied, \"my wet nurse told me that one day, if men were good, the gods \\nwould give the world a summer without ending. Perhaps we\\'ve been better than we thought, and the \\nGreat Summer is finally at hand.\" He grinned. \\nThe Lord Commander did not seem amused. \"You are not fool enough to believe that, my lord. Already \\nthe days grow shorter. There can be no mistake, Aemon has had letters from the Citadel, findings in \\naccord with his own. The end of summer stares us in the face.\" Mormont reached out and clutched \\nTyrion tightly by the hand. \"You must make them understand. I tell you, my lord, the darkness is coming. \\nThere are wild things in the woods, direwolves and mammoths and snow bears the size of aurochs, and I \\nhave seen darker shapes in my dreams.\" \\n\"In your dreams,\" Tyrion echoed, thinking how badly he needed another strong drink. \\nMormont was deaf to the edge in his voice. \"The fisherfolk near Eastwatch have glimpsed white walkers \\non the shore.\" \\nThis time Tyrion could not hold his tongue. \"The fisherfolk of Lannisport often glimpse merlings.\" \\n\"Denys Mallister writes that the mountain people are moving south, slipping past the Shadow Tower in \\nnumbers greater than ever before. They are running, my lord . . . but running from what?\" Lord \\nMormont moved to the window and stared out into the night. \"These are old bones, Lannister, but they \\nhave never felt a chill like this. Tell the king what I say, I pray you. Winter is coming, and when the Long \\nNight falls, only the Night\\'s Watch will stand between the realm and the darkness that sweeps from the \\nnorth. The gods help us all if we are not ready.\" \\n\"The gods help me if I do not get some sleep tonight. Yoren is determined to ride at first light.\" Tyrion \\ngot to his feet, sleepy from wine and tired of doom. \"I thank you for all the courtesies you have done me, \\nLord Mormont.\" \\n\"Tell them, Tyrion. Tell them and make them believe. That is all the thanks I need.\" He whistled, and his \\n  138\\n\\nraven flew to him and perched on his shoulder. Mormont smiled and gave the bird some corn from his \\npocket, and that was how Tyrion left him. \\nIt was bitter cold outside. Bundled thickly in his furs, Tyrion Lannister pulled on his gloves and nodded \\nto the poor frozen wretches standing sentry outside the Commander\\'s Keep. He set off across the yard \\nfor his own chambers in the King\\'s Tower, walking as briskly as his legs could manage. Patches of snow \\ncrunched beneath his feet as his boots broke the night\\'s crust, and his breath steamed before him like a \\nbanner. He shoved his hands into his armpits and walked faster, praying that Morrec had remembered to \\nwarm his bed with hot bricks from the fire. \\nBehind the King\\'s Tower, the Wall glimmered in the light of the moon, immense and mysterious. Tyrion \\nstopped for a moment to look up at it. His legs ached of cold and haste. \\nSuddenly a strange madness took hold of him, a yearning to look once more off the end of the world. It \\nwould be his last chance, he thought; tomorrow he would ride south, and he could not imagine why he \\nwould ever want to return to this frozen desolation. The King\\'s Tower was before him, with its promise \\nof warmth and a soft bed, yet Tyrion found himself walking past it, toward the vast pale palisade of the \\nWall. \\nA wooden stair ascended the south face, anchored on huge roughhewn beams sunk deep into the ice \\nand frozen in place. Back and forth it switched, clawing its way upward as crooked as a bolt of lightning. \\nThe black brothers assured him that it was much stronger than it looked, but Tyrion\\'s legs were cramping \\ntoo badly for him to even contemplate the ascent. He went instead to the iron cage beside the well, \\nclambered inside, and yanked hard on the bell rope, three quick pulls. \\nHe had to wait what seemed an eternity, standing there inside the bars with the Wall to his back. Long \\nenough for Tyrion to begin to wonder why he was doing this. He had just about decided to forget his \\nsudden whim and go to bed when the cage gave a jerk and began to ascend. \\nHe moved upward slowly, by fits and starts at first, then more smoothly. The ground fell away beneath \\nhim, the cage swung, and Tyrion wrapped his hands around the iron bars. He could feel the cold of the \\nmetal even through his gloves. Morrec had a fire burning in his room, he noted with approval, but the \\nLord Commander\\'s tower was dark. The Old Bear had more sense than he did, it seemed. \\nThen he was above the towers, still inching his way upward. Castle Black lay below him, etched in \\nmoonlight. You could see how stark and empty it was from up here; windowless keeps, crumbling walls, \\ncourtyards choked with broken stone. Farther off, he could see the lights of Mole\\'s Town, the little village \\nhalf a league south along the kingsroad, and here and there the bright glitter of moonlight on water where \\nicy streams descended from the mountain heights to cut across the plains. The rest of the world was a \\nbleak emptiness of windswept hills and rocky fields spotted with snow. \\nFinally a thick voice behind him said, \"Seven hells, it\\'s the dwarf,\" and the cage jerked to a sudden stop \\nand hung there, swinging slowly back and forth, the ropes creaking. \\n\"Bring him in, damn it.\" There was a grunt and a loud groaning of wood as the cage slid sideways and \\nthen the Wall was beneath him. Tyrion waited until the swinging had stopped before he pushed open the \\ncage door and hopped down onto the ice. A heavy figure in black was leaning on the winch, while a \\nsecond held the cage with a gloved hand. Their faces were muffled in woolen scarves so only their eyes \\nshowed, and they were plump with layers of wool and leather, black on black. \"And what will you be \\n  139\\n\\nwanting, this time of night?\" the one by the winch asked. \\n\"A last look.\" \\nThe men exchanged sour glances. \"Look all you want,\" the other one said. \"Just have a care you don\\'t \\nfall off, little man. The Old Bear would have our hides.\" A small wooden shack stood under the great \\ncrane, and Tyrion saw the dull glow of a brazier and felt a brief gust of warmth when the winch men \\nopened the door and went back inside. And then he was alone. \\nIt was bitingly cold up here, and the wind pulled at his clothes like an insistent lover. The top of the Wall \\nwas wider than the kingsroad \\noften was, so Tyrion had no fear of falling, although the footing was slicker than he would have liked. \\nThe brothers spread crushed stone across the walkways, but the weight of countless footsteps would \\nmelt the Wall beneath, so the ice would seem to grow around the gravel, swallowing it, until the path was \\nbare again and it was time to crush more stone. \\nStill, it was nothing that Tyrion could not manage. He looked off to the east and west, at the Wall \\nstretching before him, a vast white road with no beginning and no end and a dark abyss on either side. \\nWest, he decided, for no special reason, and he began to walk that way, following the pathway nearest \\nthe north edge, where the gravel looked freshest. \\nHis bare cheeks were ruddy with the cold, and his legs complained more loudly with every step, but \\nTyrion ignored them. The wind swirled around him, gravel crunched beneath his boots, while ahead the \\nwhite ribbon followed the lines of the hills, rising higher and higher, until it was lost beyond the western \\nhorizon. He passed a massive catapult, as tall as a city wall, its base sunk deep into the Wall. The \\nthrowing arm had been taken off for repairs and then forgotten; it lay there like a broken toy, \\nhalf-embedded in the ice. \\nOn the far side of the catapult, a muffled voice called out a challenge. \"Who goes there? Halt!\" \\nTyrion stopped. \"If I halt too long I\\'ll freeze in place, Jon,\" he said as a shaggy pale shape slid toward \\nhim silently and sniffed at his furs. \"Hello, Ghost.\" \\nJon Snow moved closer. He looked bigger and heavier in his layers of fur and leather, the hood of his \\ncloak pulled down over his face. \"Lannister,\" he said, yanking loose the scarf to uncover his mouth. \"This \\nis the last place I would have expected to see you.\" He carried a heavy spear tipped in iron, taller than he \\nwas, and a sword hung at his side in a leather sheath. Across his chest was a gleaming black warhorn, \\nbanded with silver. \\n\"This is the last place I would have expected to be seen,\" Tyrion admitted. \"I was captured by a whim. If \\nI touch Ghost, will he chew my hand off?\" \\n\"Not with me here,\" Jon promised. \\nTyrion scratched the white wolf behind the ears. The red eyes watched him impassively. The beast came \\nup as high as his chest now. Another year, and Tyrion had the gloomy feeling he\\'d be looking up at him. \\n\"What are you doing up here tonight?\" he asked. \"Besides freezing your manhood off . . .\" \\n  140\\n\\n\"I have drawn night guard,\" Jon said. \"Again. Ser Alliser has kindly arranged for the watch commander \\nto take a special interest in me. He seems to think that if they keep me awake half the night, I\\'ll fall asleep \\nduring morning drill. So far I have disappointed him.\" \\nTyrion grinned. \"And has Ghost learned to juggle yet?\" \\n\"No,\" said Jon, smiling, \"but Grenn held his own against Halder this morning, and Pyp is no longer \\ndropping his sword quite so often as he did.\" \\n\"Pyp?\" \\n\"Pypar is his real name. The small boy with the large ears. He saw me working with Grenn and asked for \\nhelp. Thorne had never even shown him the proper way to grip a sword.\" He turned to look north. \"I \\nhave a mile of Wall to guard. Will you walk with me?\" \\n\"If you walk slowly,\" Tyrion said. \\n\"The watch commander tells me I must walk, to keep my blood from freezing, but he never said how \\nfast.\" \\nThey walked, with Ghost pacing along beside Jon like a white shadow. \"I leave on the morrow,\" Tyrion \\nsaid. \\n\"I know.\" Jon sounded strangely sad. \\n\"I plan to stop at Winterfell on the way south. If there is any message that you would like me to deliver . \\n. .\" \\n\"Tell Robb that I\\'m going to command the Night\\'s Watch and keep him safe, so he might as well take up \\nneedlework with the girls and have Mikken melt down his sword for horseshoes.\" \\n\"Your brother is bigger than me,\" Tyrion said with a laugh. \"I decline to deliver any message that might \\nget me killed.\" \\n\"Rickon will ask when I\\'m coming home. Try to explain where I\\'ve gone, if you can. Tell him he can have \\nall my things while I\\'m away, he\\'ll like that.\" \\nPeople seemed to be asking a great deal of him today, Tyrion Lannister thought. \"You could put all this \\nin a letter, you know.\" \\n\"Rickon can\\'t read yet. Bran . . .\" He stopped suddenly. \"I don\\'t know what message to send to Bran. \\nHelp him, Tyrion.\" \\n\"What help could I give him? I am no maester, to ease his pain. I have no spells to give him back his \\nlegs.\" \\n\"You gave me help when I needed it,\" Jon Snow said. \\n\"I gave you nothing,\" Tyrion said. \"Words.\" \\n  141\\n\\n\"Then give your words to Bran too.\" \\n\"You\\'re asking a lame man to teach a cripple how to dance,\" Tyrion said. \"However sincere the lesson, \\nthe result is likely to be grotesque. Still, I know what it is to love a brother, Lord Snow. I will give Bran \\nwhatever small help is in my power.\" \\n\"Thank you, my lord of Lannister.\" He pulled off his glove and offered his bare hand. \"Friend.\" \\nTyrion found himself oddly touched. \"Most of my kin are bastards,\" he said with a wry smile, \"but you\\'re \\nthe first I\\'ve had to friend.\" He pulled a glove off with his teeth and clasped Snow by the hand, flesh \\nagainst flesh. The boy\\'s grip was firm and strong. \\nWhen he had donned his glove again, Jon Snow turned abruptly and walked to the low, icy northern \\nparapet. Beyond him the Wall fell away sharply; beyond him there was only the darkness and the wild. \\nTyrion followed him, and side by side they stood upon the edge of the world. \\nThe Night\\'s Watch permitted the forest to come no closer than half a mile of the north face of the Wall. \\nThe thickets of ironwood and sentinel and oak that had once grown there had been harvested centuries \\nago, to create a broad swath of open ground through which no enemy could hope to pass unseen. Tyrion \\nhad heard that elsewhere along the Wall, between the three fortresses, the wildwood had come creeping \\nback over the decades, that there were places where greygreen sentinels and pale white weirwoods had \\ntaken root in the shadow of the Wall itself, but Castle Black had a prodigious appetite for firewood, and \\nhere the forest was still kept at bay by the axes of the black brothers. \\nIt was never far, though. From up here Tyrion could see it, the dark trees looming beyond the stretch of \\nopen ground, like a second wall built parallel to the first, a wall of night. Few axes had ever swung in that \\nblack wood, where even the moonlight could not penetrate the ancient tangle of root and thorn and \\ngrasping limb. Out there the trees grew huge, and the rangers said they seemed to brood and knew not \\nmen. It was small wonder the Night\\'s Watch named it the haunted forest. \\nAs he stood there and looked at all that darkness with no fires burning anywhere, with the wind blowing \\nand the cold like a spear in his guts, Tyrion Lannister felt as though he could almost believe the talk of the \\nOthers, the enemy in the night. His jokes of grumkins and snarks no longer seemed quite so droll. \\n\"My uncle is out there,\" Jon Snow said softly, leaning on his spear as he stared off into the darkness. \\n\"The first night they sent me up here, I thought, Uncle Benjen will ride back tonight, and I\\'ll see him first \\nand blow the horn. He never came, though. Not that night and not any night.\" \\n\"Give him time,\" Tyrion said. \\nFar off to the north, a wolf began to howl. Another voice picked up \\nthe call, then another. Ghost cocked his head and listened. \"If he doesn\\'t come back,\" Jon Snow \\npromised, \"Ghost and I will go find him.\" He put his hand on the direwolf\\'s head. \\n\"I believe you,\" Tyrion said, but what he thought was, And who will go find you? He shivered. \\n  142\\n\\nARYA \\nHer father had been fighting with the council again. Arya could see it on his face when he came to table, \\nlate again, as he had been so often. The first course, a thick sweet soup made with pumpkins, had \\nalready been taken away when Ned Stark strode into the Small Hall. They called it that to set it apart \\nfrom the Great Hall, where the king could feast a thousand, but it was a long room with a high vaulted \\nceiling and bench space for two hundred at its trestle tables. \\n\"My lord,\" Jory said when Father entered. He rose to his feet, and the rest of the guard rose with him. \\nEach man wore a new cloak, heavy grey wool with a white satin border. A hand of beaten silver clutched \\nthe woolen folds of each cloak and marked their wearers as men of the Hand\\'s household guard. There \\nwere only fifty of them, so most of the benches were empty. \\n\"Be seated,\" Eddard Stark said. \"I see you have started without me. I am pleased to know there are still \\nsome men of sense in this city.\" He signaled for the meal to resume. The servants began bringing out \\nplatters of ribs, roasted in a crust of garlic and herbs. \\n\"The talk in the yard is we shall have a tourney, my lord,\" Jory said as he resumed his seat. \"They say \\nthat knights will come from all over the realm to joust and feast in honor of your appointment as Hand of \\nthe King.\" \\nArya could see that her father was not very happy about that. \"Do they also say this is the last thing in \\nthe world I would have wished?\" \\nSansa\\'s eyes had grown wide as the plates. \"A tourney,\" she breathed. She was seated between Septa \\nMordane and Jeyne Poole, as far from Arya as she could get without drawing a reproach from Father. \\n\"Will we be permitted to go, Father?\" \\n\"You know my feelings, Sansa. It seems I must arrange Robert\\'s games and pretend to be honored for \\nhis sake. That does not mean I must subject my daughters to this folly.\" \\n\"Oh, please,\" Sansa said. \"I want to see.\" \\nSepta Mordane spoke up. \"Princess Myrcella will be there, my lord, and her younger than Lady Sansa. \\nAll the ladies of the court will be expected at a grand event like this, and as the tourney is in your honor, it \\nwould look queer if your family did not attend.\" \\nFather looked pained. \"I suppose so. Very well, I shall arrange a place for you, Sansa.\" He saw Arya. \\n\"For both of you.\" \\n\"I don\\'t care about their stupid tourney,\" Arya said. She knew Prince Jofftey would be there, and she \\nhated Prince Joffrey. \\nSansa lifted her head. \"It will be a splendid event. You shan\\'t be wanted.\" \\nAnger flashed across Father\\'s face. \"Enough, Sansa. More of that and you will change my mind. I am \\n  143\\n\\nweary unto death of this endless war you two are fighting. You are sisters. I expect you to behave like \\nsisters, is that understood?\" \\nSansa bit her lip and nodded. Arya lowered her face to stare sullenly at her plate. She could feel tears \\nstinging her eyes. She rubbed them away angrily, determined not to cry. \\nThe only sound was the clatter of knives and forks. \"Pray excuse me,\" her father announced to the table. \\n\"I find I have small appetite tonight.\" He walked from the hall. \\nAfter he was gone, Sansa exchanged excited whispers with Jeyne Poole. Down the table Jory laughed at \\na joke, and Hullen started in about horseflesh. \"Your warhorse, now, he may not be the best one for the \\njoust. Not the same thing, oh, no, not the same at all.\" The men had heard it all before; Desmond, Jacks, \\nand Hullen\\'s son Harwin shouted him down together, and Porther called for more wine. \\nNo one talked to Arya. She didn\\'t care. She liked it that way. She would have eaten her meals alone in \\nher bedchamber if they let her. Sometimes they did, when Father had to dine with the king or some lord \\nor the envoys from this place or that place. The rest of the time, they ate in his solar, just him and her and \\nSansa. That was when Arya missed her brothers most. She wanted to tease Bran and play with \\nbaby Rickon and have Robb smile at her. She wanted Jon to muss up her hair and call her \"little sister\" \\nand finish her sentences with her. But all of them were gone. She had no one left but Sansa, and Sansa \\nwouldn\\'t even talk to her unless Father made her. \\nBack at Winterfell, they had eaten in the Great Hall almost half the time. Her father used to say that a \\nlord needed to eat with his men, if he hoped to keep them. \"Know the men who follow you,\" she heard \\nhim tell Robb once, \"and let them know you. Don\\'t ask your men to die for a stranger.\" At Winterfell, he \\nalways had an extra seat set at his own table, and every day a different man would be asked to join him. \\nOne night it would be Vayon Poole, and the talk would be coppers and bread stores and servants. The \\nnext time it would be Mikken, and her father would listen to him go on about armor and swords and how \\nhot a forge should be and the best way to temper steel. Another day it might be Hullen with his endless \\nhorse talk, or Septon Chayle from the library, or Jory, or Ser Rodrik, or even Old Nan with her stories. \\nArya had loved nothing better than to sit at her father\\'s table and listen to them talk. She had loved \\nlistening to the men on the benches too; to freeriders tough as leather, courtly knights and bold young \\nsquires, grizzled old men-at-arms. She used to throw snowballs at them and help them steal pies from the \\nkitchen. Their wives gave her scones and she invented names for their babies and played \\nmonsters-andmaidens and hide-the-treasure and come-into-my-castle with their children. Fat Tom used \\nto call her \"Arya Underfoot,\" because he said that was where she always was. She\\'d liked that a lot \\nbetter than \"Arya Horseface.\" \\nOnly that was Winterfell, a world away, and now everything was changed. This was the first time they \\nhad supped with the men since arriving in King\\'s Landing. Arya hated it. She hated the sounds of their \\nvoices now, the way they laughed, the stories they told. They\\'d been her friends, she\\'d felt safe around \\nthem, but now she knew that was a lie. They\\'d let the queen kill Lady, that was horrible enough, but then \\nthe Hound found Mycah. Jeyne Poole had told Arya that he\\'d cut him up in so many pieces that they\\'d \\ngiven him back to the butcher in a bag, and at first the poor man had thought it was a pig they\\'d \\nslaughtered. And no one had raised a voice or drawn a blade or anything, not Harwin who always talked \\nso bold, or Alyn who was going to be a knight, or Jory who was captain of the guard. Not even her \\nfather. \\n  144\\n\\n\"He was my ffiend,\" Arya whispered into her plate, so low that no one could hear. Her ribs sat there \\nuntouched, grown cold now, a thin film of grease congealing beneath them on the plate. Arya looked at \\nthem and felt ill. She pushed away from the table. \\n\"Pray, where do you think you are going, young lady?\" Septa Mordane asked. \\n\"I\\'m not hungry.\" Arya found it an effort to remember her courtesies. \"May I be excused, please?\" she \\nrecited stiffly. \\n\"You may not,\" the septa said. \"You have scarcely touched your food. You will sit down and clean your \\nplate.\" \\n\"You clean it!\" Before anyone could stop her, Arya bolted for the door as the men laughed and Septa \\nMordane called loudly after her, her voice rising higher and higher. \\nFat Tom was at his post, guarding the door to the Tower of the Hand. He blinked when he saw Arya \\nrushing toward him and heard the septa\\'s shouts. \"Here now, little one, hold on,\" he started to say, \\nreaching, but Arya slid between his legs and then she was running up the winding tower steps, her feet \\nhammering on the stone while Fat Tom huffed and puffed behind her. \\nHer bedchamber was the only place that Arya liked in all of King\\'s Landing, and the thing she liked best \\nabout it was the door, a massive slab of dark oak with black iron bands. When she slammed that door \\nand dropped the heavy crossbar, nobody could get into her room, not Septa Mordane or Fat Tom or \\nSansa or Jory or the Hound, nobody! She slammed it now. \\nWhen the bar was down, Arya finally felt safe enough to cry. \\nShe went to the window seat and sat there, sniffling, hating them all, and herself most of all. It was all her \\nfault, everything bad that had happened. Sansa said so, and Jeyne too. \\nFat Tom was knocking on her door. \"Arya girl, what\\'s wrong?\" he called out. \"You in there?\" \\n\"No!\" she shouted. The knocking stopped. A moment later she heard him going away. Fat Tom was \\nalways easy to fool. \\nArya went to the chest at the foot of her bed. She knelt, opened the lid, and began pulling her clothes \\nout with both hands, grabbing handfuls of silk and satin and velvet and wool and tossing them on the \\nfloor. It was there at the bottom of the chest, where she\\'d hidden it. Arya lifted it out almost tenderly and \\ndrew the slender blade from its sheath. \\nNeedle. \\nShe thought of Mycah again and her eyes filled with tears. Her fault, her fault, her fault. If she had never \\nasked him to play at swords with her . . . \\nThere was a pounding at her door, louder than before. \\'Arya Stark, you open this door at once, do you \\nhear me?\" \\n  145\\n\\nArya spun around, with Needle in her hand. \"You better not come in here!\" she warned. She slashed at \\nthe air savagely. \\n\"The Hand will hear of this!\" Septa Mordane raged. \\n\"I don\\'t care,\" Arya screamed. \"Go away.\" \\n\"You will rue this insolent behavior, young lady, I promise you that. \\nArya listened at the door until she heard the sound of the septa\\'s receding footsteps. \\nShe went back to the window, Needle in hand, and looked down into the courtyard below. If only she \\ncould climb like Bran, she thought; she would go out the window and down the tower, run away from \\nthis horrible place, away from Sansa and Septa Mordane and Prince Joffrey, from all of them. Steal \\nsome food from the kitchens, take Needle and her good boots and a warm cloak. She could find \\nNymeria in the wild woods below the Trident, and together they\\'d return to Winterfell, or run to Jon on \\nthe Wall. She found herself wishing that Jon was here with her now. Then maybe she wouldn\\'t feel so \\nalone. \\nA soft knock at the door behind her turned Arya away from the window and her dreams of escape. \\n\"Arya,\" her father\\'s voice called out. \"Open the door. We need to talk.\" \\nArya crossed the room and lifted the crossbar. Father was alone. He seemed more sad than angry. That \\nmade Arya feel even worse. \"May I come in?\" Arya nodded, then dropped her eyes, ashamed. Father \\nclosed the door. \"Whose sword is that?\" \\n\"Mine.\" Arya had almost forgotten Needle, in her hand. \\n\"Give it to me.\" \\nReluctantly Arya surrendered her sword, wondering if she would ever hold it again. Her father turned it \\nin the light, examining both sides of the blade. He tested the point with his thumb. \"A bravo\\'s blade,\" he \\nsaid. \"Yet it seems to me that I know this maker\\'s mark. This is Mikken\\'s work.\" \\nArya could not lie to him. She lowered her eyes. \\nLord Eddard Stark sighed. \"My nine-year-old daughter is being armed from my own forge, and I know \\nnothing of it. The Hand of the King is expected to rule the Seven Kingdoms, yet it seems I cannot even \\nrule my own household. How is it that you come to own a sword, Arya? Where did you get this?\" \\nArya chewed her lip and said nothing. She would not betray Jon, not even to their father. \\nAfter a while, Father said, \"I don\\'t suppose it matters, truly.\" He looked down gravely at the sword in his \\nhands. \"This is no toy for children, least of all for a girl. What would Septa Mordane say if she knew you \\nwere playing with swords?\" \\n\"I wasn\\'t playing,\" Arya insisted. \"I hate Septa Mordane.\" \\n  146\\n\\n\"That\\'s enough.\" Her father\\'s voice was curt and hard. \"The septa is doing no more than is her duty, \\nthough gods know you have made it a struggle for the poor woman. Your mother and I have charged her \\nwith the impossible task of making you a lady.\" \\n\"I don\\'t want to be a lady!\" Arya flared. \\n\"I ought to snap this toy across my knee here and now, and put an end to this nonsense.\" \\n\"Needle wouldn\\'t break,\" Arya said defiantly, but her voice betrayed her words. \\n\"It has a name, does it?\" Her father sighed. \"Ah, Arya. You have a wildness in you, child. \\'The wolf \\nblood,\\' my father used to call it. Lyanna had a touch of it, and my brother Brandon more than a touch. It \\nbrought them both to an early grave.\" Arya heard sadness in his voice; he did not often speak of his \\nfather, or of the brother and sister who had died before she was born. \"Lyanna might have carried a \\nsword, if my lord father had allowed it. You remind me of her sometimes. You even look like her.\" \\n\"Lyanna was beautiful,\" Arya said, startled. Everybody said so. It was not a thing that was ever said of \\nArya. \\n\"She was,\" Eddard Stark agreed, \"beautiful, and willful, and dead before her time.\" He lifted the sword, \\nheld it out between them. \"Arya, what did you think to do with this . . . Needle? Who did you hope to \\nskewer? Your sister? Septa Mordane? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?\" \\nAll she could think of was the lesson Jon had given her. \"Stick them with the pointy end,\" she blurted \\nout. \\nHer father snorted back laughter. \"That is the essence of it, I suppose.\" \\nArya desperately wanted to explain, to make him see. \"I was trying to learn, but . . .\" Her eyes filled with \\ntears. \"I asked Mycah to practice with me.\" The grief came on her all at once. She turned away, shaking. \\n\"I asked him,\" she cried. \"It was my fault, it was me . . .\" \\nSuddenly her father\\'s arms were around her. He held her gently as she turned to him and sobbed against \\nhis chest. \"No, sweet one,\" he murmured. \"Grieve for your friend, but never blame yourself. You did not \\nkill the butcher\\'s boy. That murder lies at the Hound\\'s door, him and the cruel woman he serves.\" \\n\"I hate them,\" Arya confided, red-faced, sniffling. \"The Hound and the queen and the king and Prince \\nJoffrey. I hate all of them. Joffrey lied, it wasn\\'t the way he said. I hate Sansa too. She did remember, she \\njust lied so Joffrey would like her.\" \\n\"We all lie,\" her father said. \"Or did you truly think I\\'d believe that Nymeria ran off?\" \\nArya blushed guiltily. \"Jory promised not to tell.\" \\n\"Jory kept his word,\" her father said with a smile. \"There are some things I do not need to be told. Even \\na blind man could see that wolf would never have left you willingly.\" \\n\"We had to throw rocks,\" she said miserably. \"I told her to run, to go be free, that I didn\\'t want her \\n  147\\n\\nanymore. There were other wolves for her to play with, we heard them howling, and Jory said the woods \\nwere full of game, so she\\'d have deer to hunt. Only she kept following, and finally we had to throw rocks. \\nI hit her twice. She whined and looked at me and I felt so \\'shamed, but it was right, wasn\\'t it? The queen \\nwould have killed her.\" \\n\"It was right,\" her father said. \"And even the lie was . . . not without honor.\" He\\'d put Needle aside when \\nhe went to Arya to embrace her. Now he took the blade up again and walked to the window, where he \\nstood for a moment, looking out across the courtyard. When he turned back, his eyes were thoughtful. \\nHe seated himself on the window seat, Needle across his lap. \"Arya, sit down. I need to try and explain \\nsome things to you.\" \\nShe perched anxiously on the edge of her bed. \"You are too young to be burdened with all my cares,\" \\nhe told her, \"but you are also a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.\" \\n\"Winter is coming, \" Arya whispered. \\n\"The hard cruel times,\" her father said. \"We tasted them on the Trident, child, and when Bran fell. You \\nwere born in the long summer, sweet one, you\\'ve never known anything else, but now the winter is truly \\ncoming. Remember the sigil of our House, Arya.\" \\n\"The direwolf,\" she said, thinking of Nymeria. She hugged her knees against her chest, suddenly afraid. \\n\"Let me tell you something about wolves, child. When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone \\nwolf dies, but the pack survives. Summer is the time for squabbles. In winter, we must protect one \\nanother, keep each other warm, share our strengths. So if you must hate, Arya, hate those who would \\ntruly do us harm. Septa Mordane is a good woman, and Sansa . . . Sansa is your sister. You may be as \\ndifferent as the sun and the moon, but the same blood flows through both your hearts. You need her, as \\nshe needs you . . . and I need both of you, gods help me.\" \\nHe sounded so tired that it made Arya sad. \"I don\\'t hate Sansa,\" she told him. \"Not truly.\" It was only \\nhalf a lie. \\n\"I do not mean to frighten you, but neither will I lie to you. We have \\ncome to a dark dangerous place, child. This is not Winterfell. We have enemies who mean us ill. We \\ncannot fight a war among ourselves. This willfulness of yours, the running off, the angry words, the \\ndisobedience . . . at home, these were only the summer games of a child. Here and now, with winter \\nsoon upon us, that is a different matter. It is time to begin growing up.\" \\n\"I will,\" Arya vowed. She had never loved him so much as she did in that instant. \"I can be strong too. I \\ncan be as strong as Robb.\" \\nHe held Needle out to her, hilt first. \"Here.,, \\nShe looked at the sword with wonder in her eyes. For a moment she was afraid to touch it, afraid that if \\nshe reached for it it would be snatched away again, but then her father said, \"Go on, it\\'s yours,\" and she \\ntook it in her hand. \\n\"I can keep it?\" she said. \"For true?\" \\n  148\\n\\n\"For true.\" He smiled. \"If I took it away, no doubt I\\'d find a morningstar hidden under your pillow within \\nthe fortnight. Try not to stab your sister, whatever the provocation.\" \\n\"I won\\'t. I promise.\" Arya clutched Needle tightly to her chest as her father took his leave. \\nThe next morning, as they broke their fast, she apologized to Septa Mordane and asked for her pardon. \\nThe septa peered at her suspiciously, but Father nodded. \\nThree days later, at midday, her father\\'s steward Vayon Poole sent Arya to the Small Hall. The trestle \\ntables had been dismantled and the benches shoved against the walls. The hall seemed empty, until an \\nunfamiliar voice said, \"You are late, boy.\" A slight man with a bald head and a great beak of a nose \\nstepped out of the shadows, holding a pair of slender wooden swords. \"Tomorrow you will be here at \\nmidday.\" He had an accent, the lilt of the Free Cities, Braavos perhaps, or Myr. \\n\"Who are you?\" Arya asked. \\n\"I am your dancing master.\" He tossed her one of the wooden blades. She grabbed for it, missed, and \\nheard it clatter to the floor. \"Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up.\" \\nIt was not just a stick, but a true wooden sword complete with grip and guard and pommel. Arya \\npicked it up and clutched it nervously with both hands, holding it out in front of her. It was heavier than it \\nlooked, much heavier than Needle. \\nThe bald man clicked his teeth together. \"That is not the way, boy. This is not a greatsword that is \\nneeding two hands to swing it. You will take the blade in one hand.\" \\n\"It\\'s too heavy,\" Arya said. \\n\"It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong, and for the balancing. A hollow inside is filled with \\nlead, just so. One hand now is all that is needing.\" \\nArya took her right hand off the grip and wiped her sweaty palm on her pants. She held the sword in her \\nleft hand. He seemed to approve. \"The left is good. All is reversed, it will make your enemies more \\nawkward. Now you are standing wrong. Turn your body sideface, yes, so. You are skinny as the shaft of \\na spear, do you know. That is good too, the target is smaller. Now the grip. Let me see.\" He moved \\ncloser and peered at her hand, prying her fingers apart, rearranging them. \"Just so, yes. Do not squeeze it \\nso tight, no, the grip must be deft, delicate.\" \\n\"What if I drop it?\" Arya said. \\n\"The steel must be part of your arm,\" the bald man told her. \"Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine \\nyears Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos, he knows these things. Listen to him, boy.\" \\nIt was the third time he had called her \"boy.\" \"I\\'m a girl,\" Arya objected. \\n\"Boy, girl,\" Syrio Forel said. \"You are a sword, that is all.\" He clicked his teeth together. \"Just so, that is \\nthe grip. You are not holding a battle-axe, you are holding a-\" \\n  149\\n\\n\\'~--needle, \" Arya finished for him, fiercely. \\n\"Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the iron dance of Westeros we are \\nlearning, the knight\\'s dance, hacking and hammering, no. This is the bravo\\'s dance, the water dance, swift \\nand sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? When you pierce them, the water leaks out \\nand they die.\" He took a step backward, raised his own wooden blade. \"Now you will try to strike me.,, \\nArya tried to strike him. She tried for four hours, until every muscle in her body was sore and aching, \\nwhile Syrio Forel clicked his teeth together and told her what to do. \\nThe next day their real work began. \\nDAENERYS \\n\"The Dothraki sea,\" Ser Jorah Mormont said as he reined to a halt beside her on the top of the ridge. \\nbeneath them, the plain stretched out immense and empty, a vast flat expanse that reached to the distant \\nhorizon and beyond. It was a sea, Dany thought. Past here, there were no hills, no mountains, no trees \\nnor cities nor roads, only the endless grasses, the tall blades rippling like waves when the winds blew. \\n\"It\\'s so green,\" she said. \\n\"Here and now,\" Ser Jorah agreed. \"You ought to see it when it blooms, all dark red flowers from \\nhorizon to horizon, like a sea of blood. Come the dry season, and the world turns the color of old \\nbronze. And this is only hranna, child. There are a hundred kinds of grass out there, grasses as yellow as \\nlemon and as dark as indigo, blue grasses and orange grasses and grasses like rainbows. Down in the \\nShadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are oceans of ghost grass, taller than a man on horseback \\nwith stalks as pale as milkglass. It murders all other grass and glows in the dark with the spirits of the \\ndamned. The Dothraki claim that someday ghost grass will cover the entire world, and then all life will \\nend.\" \\nThat thought gave Dany the shivers. \"I don\\'t want to talk about that now,\" she said. \"It\\'s so beautiful \\nhere, I don\\'t want to think about everything dying.\" \\n\"As you will, Khaleesi,\" Ser Jorah said respectfully. \\nShe heard the sound of voices and turned to look behind her. She and Mormont had outdistanced the \\nrest of their party, and now the others were climbing the ridge below them. Her handmaid Irri and the \\nyoung archers of her khas were fluid as centaurs, but Viserys still struggled with the short stirrups and the \\nflat saddle. Her brother was miserable out here. He ought never have come. Magister Illyrio had urged \\nhim to wait in Pentos, had offered him the hospitality of his manse, but Viserys would have none of it. He \\nwould stay with Drogo until the debt had been paid, until he had the crown he had been promised. \"And \\nif he tries to cheat me, he will learn to his sorrow what it means to wake the dragon,\" Viserys had vowed, \\nlaying a hand on his borrowed sword. Illyrio had blinked at that and wished him good fortune. \\nDany realized that she did not want to listen to any of her brother\\'s complaints right now. The day was \\ntoo perfect. The sky was a deep blue, and high above them a hunting hawk circled. The grass sea \\nswayed and sighed with each breath of wind, the air was warm on her face, and Dany felt at peace. She \\n  150\\n\\nwould not let Viserys spoil it. \\n\"Wait here,\" Dany told Ser Jorah. \"Tell them all to stay. Tell them I command it.\" \\nThe knight smiled. Ser Jorah was not a handsome man. He had a neck and shoulders like a bull, and \\ncoarse black hair covered his arms and chest so thickly that there was none left for his head. Yet his \\nsmiles gave Dany comfort. \"You are learning to talk like a queen, Daenerys.\" \\n\"Not a queen,\" said Dany. \"A khaleesi. \" She wheeled her horse about and galloped down the ridge \\nalone. \\nThe descent was steep and rocky, but Dany rode fearlessly, and the joy and the danger of it were a \\nsong in her heart. All her life Viserys had told her she was a princess, but not until she rode her silver had \\nDaenerys Targaryen ever felt like one. \\nAt first it had not come easy. The khalasar had broken camp the morning after her wedding, moving east \\ntoward Vaes Dothrak, and by the third day Dany thought she was going to die. Saddle sores opened on \\nher bottom, hideous and bloody. Her thighs were chafed raw, her hands blistered from the reins, the \\nmuscles of her legs and back so wracked with pain that she could scarcely sit. By the time dusk fell, her \\nhandmaids would need to help her down from her mount. \\nEven the nights brought no relief. Khal Drogo ignored her when they rode, even as he had ignored her \\nduring their wedding, and spent his evenings drinking with his warriors and bloodriders, racing his prize \\nhorses, watching women dance and men die. Dany had no place \\nin these parts of his life. She was left to sup alone, or with Ser Jorah and her brother, and afterward to \\ncry herself to sleep. Yet every night, some time before the dawn, Drogo would come to her tent and \\nwake her in the dark, to ride her as relentlessly as he rode his stallion. He always took her from behind, \\nDothraki fashion, for which Dany was grateful; that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet \\nher face, and she could use her pillow to muffle her cries of pain. When he was done, he would close his \\neyes and begin to snore softly and Dany would lie beside him, her body bruised and sore, hurting too \\nmuch for sleep. \\nDay followed day, and night followed night, until Dany knew she could not endure a moment longer. She \\nwould kill herself rather than go on, she decided one night . . . \\nYet when she slept that night, she dreamt the dragon dream again. Viserys was not in it this time. There \\nwas only her and the dragon. Its scales were black as night, wet and slick with blood. Her blood, Dany \\nsensed. Its eyes were pools of molten magma, and when it opened its mouth, the flame came roaring out \\nin a hot jet. She could hear it singing to her, She opened her arms to the fire, embraced it, let it swallow \\nher whole, let it cleanse her and temper her and scour her clean. She could feel her flesh sear and \\nblacken and slough away, could feel her blood boil and turn to steam, and yet there was no pain. She felt \\nstrong and new and fierce. \\nAnd the next day, strangely, she did not seem to hurt quite so much. It was as if the gods had heard her \\nand taken pity. Even her handmaids noticed the change. \"Khaleesi, \" Jhiqui said, \"what is wrong? Are you \\nsick?\" \\n\"I was,\" she answered, standing over the dragon\\'s eggs that Illyrio had given her when she wed. She \\n  151\\n\\ntouched one, the largest of the three, running her hand lightly over the shelf. Black-and-scarlet, she \\nthought, like the dragon in my dream. The stone felt strangely warm beneath her fingers . . . or was she \\nstill dreaming? She pulled her hand back nervously. \\nFrom that hour onward, each day was easier than the one before it. Her legs grew stronger; her blisters \\nburst and her hands grew callused; her soft thighs toughened, supple as leather. \\nThe khal had commanded the handmaid Irri to teach Dany to ride in the Dothraki fashion, but it was the \\nfilly who was her real teacher. The horse seemed to know her moods, as if they shared a single mind. \\nWith every passing day, Dany felt surer in her seat. The Dothraki were a hard and unsentimental people, \\nand it was not their custom to name \\ntheir animals, so Dany thought of her only as the silver. She had never loved anything so much. \\nAs the riding became less an ordeal, Dany began to notice the beauties of the land around her. She rode \\nat the head of the khalasar with Drogo and his bloodriders, so she came to each country fresh and \\nunspoiled. Behind them the great horde might tear the earth and muddy the rivers and send up clouds of \\nchoking dust, but the fields ahead of them were always green and verdant. \\nThey crossed the rolling hills of Norvos, past terraced farms and small villages where the townsfolk \\nwatched anxiously from atop white stucco walls. They forded three wide placid rivers and a fourth that \\nwas swift and narrow and treacherous, camped beside a high blue waterfall, skirted the tumbled ruins of \\na vast dead city where ghosts were said to moan among blackened marble columns. They raced down \\nValyrian roads a thousand years old and straight as a Dothraki arrow. For half a moon, they rode \\nthrough the Forest of Qohor, where the leaves made a golden canopy high above them, and the trunks of \\nthe trees were as wide as city gates. There were great elk in that wood, and spotted tigers, and lemurs \\nwith silver fur and huge purple eyes, but all fled before the approach of the khalasar and Dany got no \\nglimpse of them. \\nBy then her agony was a fading memory. She still ached after a long day\\'s riding, yet somehow the pain \\nhad a sweetness to it now, and each morning she came willingly to her saddle, eager to know what \\nwonders waited for her in the lands ahead. She began to find pleasure even in her nights, and if she still \\ncried out when Drogo took her, it was not always in pain. \\nAt the bottom of the ridge, the grasses rose around her, tall and supple. Dany slowed to a trot and rode \\nout onto the plain, losing herself in the green, blessedly alone. In the khalasar she was never alone. Khal \\nDrogo came to her only after the sun went down, but her handmaids fed her and bathed her and slept by \\nthe door of her tent, Drogo\\'s bloodriders and the men of her khas were never far, and her brother was an \\nunwelcome shadow, day and night. Dany could hear him on the top of the ridge, his voice shrill with \\nanger as he shouted at Ser Jorah. She rode on, submerging herself deeper in the Dothraki sea. \\nThe green swallowed her up. The air was rich with the scents of earth and grass, mixed with the smell of \\nhorseflesh and Dany\\'s sweat and the oil in her hair. Dothraki smells. They seemed to belong here. Dany \\nbreathed it all in, laughing. She had a sudden urge to feel the ground beneath her, to curl her toes in that \\nthick black soil. Swinging \\ndown from her saddle, she let the silver graze while she pulled off her high boots. \\n  152\\n\\nViserys came upon her as sudden as a summer storm, his horse rearing beneath him as he reined up too \\nhard. \"You dare!\" he screamed at her. \"You give commands to me? To me?\" He vaulted off the horse, \\nstumbling as he landed. His face was flushed as he struggled back to his feet. He grabbed her, shook her. \\n\"Have you forgotten who you are? Look at you. Look at you!\" \\nDany did not need to look. She was barefoot, with oiled hair, wearing Dothraki riding leathers and a \\npainted vest given her as a bride gift. She looked as though she belonged here. Viserys was soiled and \\nstained in city silks and ringmail. \\nHe was still screaming. \"You do not command the dragon. Do you understand? I am the Lord of the \\nSeven Kingdoms, I will not hear orders from some horselord\\'s slut, do you hear me?\" His hand went \\nunder her vest, his fingers digging painfully into her breast. \"Do you hear me?\" \\nDany shoved him away, hard. \\nViserys stared at her, his lilac eyes incredulous. She had never defied him. Never fought back. Rage \\ntwisted his features. He would hurt her now, and badly, she knew that. \\nCrack. \\nThe whip made a sound like thunder. The coil took Viserys around the throat and yanked him \\nbackward. He went sprawling in the grass, stunned and choking. The Dothraki riders hooted at him as he \\nstruggled to free himself. The one with the whip, young Jhogo, rasped a question. Dany did not \\nunderstand his words, but by then Irri was there, and Ser Jorah, and the rest of her khas. \"Jhogo asks if \\nyou would have him dead, Khaleesi, \" Irri said. \\n\"No,\" Dany replied. \"No.\" \\nJhogo understood that. One of the others barked out a comment, and the Dothraki laughed. Irri told her, \\n\"Quaro thinks you should take an ear to teach him respect.\" \\nHer brother was on his knees, his fingers digging under the leather coils, crying incoherently, struggling \\nfor breath. The whip was tight around his windpipe. \\n\"Tell them I do not wish him harmed,\" Dany said. \\nIrri repeated her words in Dothraki. Jhogo gave a pull on the whip, yanking Viserys around like a \\npuppet on a string. He went sprawling again, freed from the leather embrace, a thin line of blood under \\nhis chin where the whip had cut deep. \\n\"I warned him what would happen, my lady,\" Ser Jorah Mormont said. \"I told him to stay on the ridge, \\nas you commanded.\" \\n\"I know you did,\" Dany replied, watching Viserys. He lay on the ground, sucking in air noisily, red-faced \\nand sobbing. He was a pitiful thing. He had always been a pitiful thing. Why had she never seen that \\nbefore? There was a hollow place inside her where her fear had been. \\n\"Take his horse,\" Dany commanded Ser Jorah. Viserys gaped at her. He could not believe what he was \\n  153\\n\\nhearing; nor could Dany quite believe what she was saying. Yet the words came. \"Let my brother walk \\nbehind us back to the khalasar.\" Among the Dothraki, the man who does not ride was no man at all, the \\nlowest of the low, without honor or pride. \"Let everyone see him as he is.\" \\n\"No!\" Viserys screamed. He turned to Ser Jorah, pleading in the Common Tongue with words the \\nhorsemen would not understand. \"Hit her, Mormont. Hurt her. Your king commands it. Kill these \\nDothraki dogs and teach her.\" \\nThe exile knight looked from Dany to her brother; she barefoot, with dirt between her toes and oil in her \\nhair, he with his silks and steel. Dany could see the decision on his face. \"He shall walk, Khaleesi,\" he \\nsaid. He took her brother\\'s horse in hand while Dany remounted her silver. \\nViserys gaped at him, and sat down in the dirt. He kept his silence, but he would not move, and his eyes \\nwere full of poison as they rode away. Soon he was lost in the tall grass. When they could not see him \\nanymore, Dany grew afraid. \"Will he find his way back?\" she asked Ser Jorah as they rode. \\n\"Even a man as blind as your brother should be able to follow our trail,\" he replied. \\n\"He is proud. He may be too shamed to come back.\" \\nJorah laughed. \"Where else should he go? If he cannot find the khalasar, the khalasar will most surely \\nfind him. It is hard to drown in the Dothraki sea, child.\" \\nDany saw the truth of that. The khalasar was like a city on the march, but it did not march blindly. \\nAlways scouts ranged far ahead of the main column, alert for any sign of game or prey or enemies, while \\noutriders guarded their flanks. They missed nothing, not here, in this land, the place where they had come \\nfrom. These plains were a part of them . . . and of her, now. \\n\"I hit him,\" she said, wonder in her voice. Now that it was over, it seemed like some strange dream that \\nshe had dreamed. \"Ser Jorah, do you think . . . he\\'ll be so angry when he gets back She shivered. \"I \\nwoke the dragon, didn\\'t IT\\' \\nSer Jorah snorted. \"Can you wake the dead, girl? Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon, and he \\ndied on the Trident. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.\" \\nHis blunt words startled her. It seemed as though all the things she had always believed were suddenly \\ncalled into question. \"You . . . you swore him your sword . . .\" \\n\"That I did, girl,\" Ser Jorah said. \"And if your brother is the shadow of a snake, what does that make his \\nservants?\" His voice was bitter. \\n\"He is still the true king. He is . . .\" \\nJorah pulled up his horse and looked at her. \"Truth now. Would you want to see Viserys sit a throne?\" \\nDany thought about that. \"He would not be a very good king, would he?\" \\n\"There have been worse . . . but not many.\" The knight gave his heels to his mount and started off again. \\n  154\\n\\nDany rode close beside him. \"Still,\" she said, \"the common people are waiting for him. Magister Illyrio \\nsays they are sewing dragon banners and praying for Viserys to return from across the narrow sea to free \\nthem.\" \\n\"The common people pray for rain, healthy children, and a summer that never ends,\" Ser Jorah told her. \\n\"It is no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones, so long as they are left in peace.\" He \\ngave a shrug. \"They never are.\" \\nDany rode along quietly for a time, working his words like a puzzle box. It went against everything that \\nViserys had ever told her to think that the people could care so little whether a true king or a usurper \\nreigned over them. Yet the more she thought on Jorah\\'s words, the more they rang of truth. \\n\"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?\" she asked him. \\n\"Home,\" he said. His voice was thick with longing. \\n\"I pray for home too,\" she told him, believing it. \\nSer Jorah laughed. \"Look around you then, Khaleesi.\" \\nBut it was not the plains Dany saw then. It was King\\'s Landing and the great Red Keep that Aegon the \\nConqueror had built. It was Dragonstone where she had been born. In her mind\\'s eye they burned with a \\nthousand lights, a fire blazing in every window. In her mind\\'s eye, all the doors were red. \\n\"My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms,\" Dany said. She had known that for a long time, \\nshe realized. She had known it all her life. Only she had never let herself say the words, even in a \\nwhisper, but now she said them for Jorah Mormont and all the world to hear. \\nA GAML OF THRONLS 207 \\nSer Jorah gave her a measuring look. \"You think not.\" \\n\"He could not lead an army even if my lord husband gave him one,\" Dany said. \"He has no coin and the \\nonly knight who follows him reviles him as less than a snake. The Dothraki make mock of his weakness. \\nHe will never take us home.\" \\n\"Wise child.\" The knight smiled. \\n\"I am no child,\" she told him fiercely. Her heels pressed into the sides of her mount, rousing the silver to \\na gallop. Faster and faster she raced, leaving Jorah and Irri and the others far behind, the warm wind in \\nher hair and the setting sun red on her face. By the time she reached the khalasar, it was dusk. \\nThe slaves had erected her tent by the shore of a spring-fed pool. She could hear rough voices from the \\nwoven grass palace on the hill. Soon there would be laughter, when the men of her khas told the story of \\nwhat had happened in the grasses today. By the time Viserys came limping back among them, every \\nman, woman, and child in the camp would know him for a walker. There were no secrets in the khalasar. \\nDany gave the silver over to the slaves for grooming and entered her tent. It was cool and dim beneath \\nthe silk. As she let the door flap close behind her, Dany saw a finger of dusty red light reach out to touch \\nher dragon\\'s eggs across the tent. For an instant a thousand droplets of scarlet flame swam before her \\neyes. She blinked, and they were gone. \\n  155\\n\\nStone, she told herself. They are only stone, even Illyrio said so, the dragons are all dead. She put her \\npalm against the black egg, fingers spread gently across the curve of the shell. The stone was warm. \\nAlmost hot. \"The sun,\" Dany whispered. \"The sun warmed them as they rode.\" \\nShe commanded her handmaids to prepare her a bath. Doreah built a fire outside the tent, while Irri and \\nJhiqui fetched the big copper tub-another bride gift-from the packhorses and carried water from the \\npool. When the bath was steaming, Irri helped her into it and climbed in after her. \\n\"Have you ever seen a dragon?\" she asked as Irri scrubbed her back and Jhiqui sluiced sand from her \\nhair. She had heard that the first dragons had come from the east, from the Shadow Lands beyond \\nAsshai and the islands of the Jade Sea. Perhaps some were still living there, in realms strange and wild. \\n\"Dragons are gone, Khaleesi,\" Irri said. \\n\"Dead,\" agreed Jhiqui. \"Long and long ago.\" \\nViserys had told her that the last Targaryen dragons had died no more than a century and a half ago, \\nduring the reign of Aegon 111, who \\nwas called the Dragonbane. That did not seem so long ago to Dany. \"Everywhere?\" she said, \\ndisappointed. \"Even in the east?\" Magic had died in the west when the Doom fell on Valyria and the \\nLands of the Long Summer, and neither spell-forged steel nor stormsingers nor dragons could hold it \\nback, but Dany had always heard that the east was different. It was said that manticores prowled the \\nislands of the Jade Sea, that basilisks infested the jungles of Yi Ti, that spellsingers, warlocks, and \\naeromancers practiced their arts openly in Asshai, while shadowbinders and bloodmages worked terrible \\nsorceries in the black of night. Why shouldn\\'t there be dragons too? \\n\"No dragon,\" Irri said. \"Brave men kill them, for dragon terrible evil beasts. It is known.\" \\n\"It is known,\" agreed Jhiqui. \\n\"A trader from Qarth once told me that dragons came from the moon,\" blond Doreah said as she \\nwarmed a towel over the fire. Jhiqui and Irri were of an age with Dany, Dothraki girls taken as slaves \\nwhen Drogo destroyed their father\\'s khalasar. Doreah was older, almost twenty. Magister Illyrio had \\nfound her in a pleasure house in Lys. \\nSilvery-wet hair tumbled across her eyes as Dany turned her head, curious. \"The moon?\" \\n\"He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi,\" the Lysene girl said. \"Once there were two moons in the \\nsky, but one wandered too close to the sun and cracked from the heat. A thousand thousand dragons \\npoured forth, and drank the fire of the sun. That is why dragons breathe flame. One day the other moon \\nwill kiss the sun too, and then it will crack and the dragons will return.\" \\nThe two Dothraki girls giggled and laughed. \"You are foolish strawhead slave,\" Irri said. \"Moon is no \\negg. Moon is god, woman wife of sun. It is known.\" \\n\"It is known,\" Jhiqui agreed. \\n  156\\n\\nDany\\'s skin was flushed and pink when she climbed from the tub. Jhiqui laid her down to oil her body \\nand scrape the dirt from her pores. Afterward Irri sprinkled her with spiceflower and cinnamon. While \\nDoreah brushed her hair until it shone like spun silver, she thought about the moon, and eggs, and \\ndragons. \\nHer supper was a simple meal of fruit and cheese and fry bread, with a jug of honeyed wine to wash it \\ndown. \"Doreah, stay and eat with me,\" Dany commanded when she sent her other handmaids away. The \\nLysene girl had hair the color of honey, and eyes like the summer sky. \\nShe lowered those eyes when they were alone. \"You honor me, Khaleesi, \" she said, but it was no \\nhonor, only service. Long after the moon had risen, they sat together, talking. \\nThat night, when Khal Drogo came, Dany was waiting for him. He stood in the door of her tent and \\nlooked at her with surprise. She rose slowly and opened her sleeping silks and let them fall to the ground. \\n\"This night we must go outside, my lord,\" she told him, for the Dothraki believed that all things of \\nimportance in a man\\'s life must be done beneath the open sky. \\nKhal Drogo followed her out into the moonlight, the bells in his hair tinkling softly. A few yards from her \\ntent was a bed of soft grass, and it was there that Dany drew him down. When he tried to turn her over, \\nshe put a hand on his chest. \"No,\" she said. \"This night I would look on your face.\" \\nThere is no privacy in the heart of the khalasar. Dany felt the eyes on her as she undressed him, heard \\nthe soft voices as she did the things that Doreah had told her to do. It was nothing to her. Was she not \\nkhaleesi? His were the only eyes that mattered, and when she mounted him she saw something there that \\nshe had never seen before. She rode him as fiercely as ever she had ridden her silver, and when the \\nmoment of his pleasure came, Khal Drogo called out her name. \\nThey were on the far side of the Dothraki sea when Jhiqui brushed the soft swell of Dany\\'s stomach with \\nher fingers and said, \"Khaleesi, you are with child.\" \\n\"I know,\" Dany told her. \\nIt was her fourteenth name day. \\nBRAN \\nIn the yard below, Rickon ran with the wolves. \\nBran watched from his window seat. Wherever the boy went, \\nGrey Wind was there first, loping ahead to cut him off, until Rickon saw him, screamed in delight, and \\nwent pelting off in another direction. Shaggydog ran at his heels, spinning and snapping if the other wolves \\ncame too close. His fur had darkened until he was all black, and his eyes were green fire. Bran\\'s Summer \\ncame last. He was silver and smoke, with eyes of yellow gold that saw all there was to see. Smaller than \\nGrey Wind, and more wary. Bran thought he was the smartest of the litter. He could hear his brother\\'s \\nbreathless laughter as Rickon dashed across the hardpacked earth on little baby legs. \\n  157\\n\\nHis eyes stung. He wanted to be down there, laughing and running. Angry at the thought, Bran knuckled \\naway the tears before they could fall. His eighth name day had come and gone. He was almost a man \\ngrown now, too old to cry. \\n\"It was just a lie,\" he said bitterly, remembering the crow from his dream. \"I can\\'t fly. I can\\'t even run.\" \\n\"Crows are all liars,\" Old Nan agreed, from the chair where she sat doing her needlework. \"I know a \\nstory about a crow.\" \\n\"I don\\'t want any more stories,\" Bran snapped, his voice petulant. He had liked Old Nan and her stories \\nonce. Before. But it was different now. They left her with him all day now, to watch over him and \\nclean him and keep him from being lonely, but she just made it worse. \"I hate your stupid stories.\" \\nThe old woman smiled at him toothlessly. \"My stories? No, my little lord, not mine. The stories are, \\nbefore me and after me, before you too.\" \\nShe was a very ugly old woman, Bran thought spitefully; shrunken and wrinkled, almost blind, too weak \\nto climb stairs, with only a few wisps of white hair left to cover a mottled pink scalp. No one really knew \\nhow old she was, but his father said she\\'d been called Old Nan even when he was a boy. She was the \\noldest person in Winterfell for certain, maybe the oldest person in the Seven Kingdoms. Nan had come \\nto the castle as a wet nurse for a Brandon Stark whose mother had died birthing him. He had been an \\nolder brother of Lord Rickard, Bran\\'s grandfather, or perhaps a younger brother, or a brother to Lord \\nRickard\\'s father. Sometimes Old Nan told it one way and sometimes another. In all the stories the little \\nboy died at three of a summer chill, but Old Nan stayed on at Winterfell with her own children. She had \\nlost both her sons to the war when King Robert won the throne, and her grandson was killed on the walls \\nof Pyke during Balon Greyjoy\\'s rebellion. Her daughters had long ago married and moved away and \\ndied. All that was left of her own blood was Hodor, the simpleminded giant who worked in the stables, \\nbut Old Nan just lived on and on, doing her needlework and telling her stories. \\n\"I don\\'t care whose stories they are,\" Bran told her, \"I hate them.\" He didn\\'t want stories and he didn\\'t \\nwant Old Nan. He wanted his mother and father. He wanted to go running with Summer loping beside \\nhim. He wanted to climb the broken tower and feed corn to the crows. He wanted to ride his pony again \\nwith his brothers. He wanted it to be the way it had been before. \\n\"I know a story about a boy who hated stories,\" Old Nan said with her stupid little smile, her needles \\nmoving all the while, click click click, until Bran was ready to scream at her. \\nIt would never be the way it had been, he knew. The crow had tricked him into flying, but when he \\nwoke up he was broken and the world was changed. They had all left him, his father and his mother and \\nhis sisters and even his bastard brother Jon. His father had promised he would ride a real horse to King\\'s \\nLanding, but they\\'d gone without him. Maester Luwin had sent a bird after Lord Eddard with a message, \\nand another to Mother and a third to Jon on the Wall, but there had been no answers. \"Ofttimes the birds \\nare lost, child,\" the maester had told him. \"There\\'s many a mile and many a hawk between here and \\nKing\\'s Landing, the message may not have reached them.\" \\nYet to Bran it felt as if they had all died while he had slept ... or perhaps Bran had died, and they had \\n  158\\n\\nforgotten him. Jory and Ser Rodrik and Vayon Poole had gone too, and Hullen and Harwin and Fat Tom \\nand a quarter of the guard. \\nOnly Robb and baby Rickon were still here, and Robb was changed. He was Robb the Lord now, or \\ntrying to be. He wore a real sword and never smiled. His days were spent drilling the guard and \\npracticing his swordplay, making the yard ring with the sound of steel as Bran watched forlornly from his \\nwindow. At night he closeted himself with Maester Luwin, talking or going over account books. \\nSometimes he would ride out with Hallis Mollen and be gone for days at a time, visiting distant holdfasts. \\nWhenever he was away more than a day, Rickon would cry and ask Bran if Robb was ever coming \\nback. Even when he was home at Winterfell, Robb the Lord seemed to have more time for Hallis Mollen \\nand Theon Greyjoy than he ever did for his brothers. \\n\"I could tell you the story about Brandon the Builder,\" Old Nan said. \"That was always your favorite.\" \\nThousands and thousands of years ago, Brandon the Builder had raised Winterfell, and some said the \\nWall. Bran knew the story, but it had never been his favorite. Maybe one of the other Brandons had \\nliked that story. Sometimes Nan would talk to him as if he were her Brandon, the baby she had nursed all \\nthose years ago, and sometimes she confused him with his uncle Brandon, who was killed by the Mad \\nKing before Bran was even born. She had lived so long, Mother had told him once, that all the Brandon \\nStarks had become one person in her head. \\n\"That\\'s not my favorite,\" he said. \"My favorites were the scary ones.\" He heard some sort of commotion \\noutside and turned back to the window. Rickon was running across the yard toward the gatehouse, the \\nwolves following him, but the tower faced the wrong way for Bran to see what was happening. He \\nsmashed a fist on his thigh in frustration and felt nothing. \\n\"Oh, my sweet summer child,\" Old Nan said quietly, \"what do you know of fear? Fear is for the winter, \\nmy little lord, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep and the ice wind comes howling out of the north. \\nFear is for the long night, when the sun hides its face for years at a time, and little children are born and \\nlive and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry, and the white walkers move \\nthrough the woods.\" \\n\"You mean the Others,\" Bran said querulously. \\n\"The Others,\" Old Nan agreed. \"Thousands and thousands of years \\nA GAML OF THRONLS 213 \\nago, a winter fell that was cold and hard and endless beyond all memory of man. There came a night that \\nlasted a generation, and kings shivered and died in their castles even as the swineherds in their hovels. \\nWomen smothered their children rather than see them starve, and cried, and felt their tears freeze on their \\ncheeks.\" Her voice and her needles fell silent, and she glanced up at Bran with pale, filmy eyes and \\nasked, \"So, child. This is the sort of story you like?\" \\n\"Well,\" Bran said reluctantly, \"yes, only . . . \\nOld Nan nodded. \"In that darkness, the Others came for the first time,\" she said as her needles went \\nclick click click. \"They were cold things, dead things, that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, \\nand every creature with hot blood in its veins. They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms, felled \\nheroes and armies by the score, riding their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain. All the \\nswords of men could not stay their advance, and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in them. \\n  159\\n\\nThey hunted the maids through frozen forests, and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children.\" \\nHer voice had dropped very low, almost to a whisper, and Bran found himself leaning forward to listen. \\n\"Now these were the days before the Andals came, and long before the women fled across the narrow \\nsea from the cities of the Rhoyne, and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the \\nFirst Men, who had taken these lands from the children of the forest. Yet here and there in the fastness of \\nthe woods the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills, and the faces in the trees kept \\nwatch. So as cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in the \\nhopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost. He set out into the dead \\nlands with a sword, a horse, a dog, and a dozen companions. For years he searched, until he despaired \\nof ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities. One by one his friends died, and his horse, \\nand finally even his dog, and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it. And the \\nOthers smelled the hot blood in him, and came silent on his trail, stalking him with packs of pale white \\nspiders big as hounds-\" \\nThe door opened with a bang, and Bran\\'s heart leapt up into his mouth in sudden fear, but it was only \\nMaester Luwin, with Hodor looming in the stairway behind him. \"Hodor!\" the stableboy announced, as \\nwas his custom, smiling hugely at them all. \\nMaester Luwin was not smiling. \"We have visitors,\" he announced, \"and your presence is required, \\nBran.\" \\n\"I\\'m listening to a story now,\" Bran complained. \\n\"Stories wait, my little lord, and when you come back to them, why, there they are,\" Old Nan said. \\n\"Visitors are not so patient, and ofttimes they bring stories of their own.\" \\n\"Who is it?\" Bran asked Maester Luwin. \\n\"Tyrion Lannister, and some men of the Night\\'s Watch, with word from your brother Jon. Robb is \\nmeeting with them now. Hodor, will you help Bran down to the hall?\" \\n\"Hodor!\" Hodor agreed happily. He ducked to get his great shaggy head under the door. Hodor was \\nnearly seven feet tall. It was hard to believe that he was the same blood as Old Nan. Bran wondered if \\nhe would shrivel up as small as his great-grandmother when he was old. It did not seem likely, even if \\nHodor lived to be a thousand. \\nHodor lifted Bran as easy as if he were a bale of hay, and cradled him against his massive chest. He \\nalways smelled faintly of horses, but it was not a bad smell. His arms were thick with muscle and matted \\nwith brown hair. \"Hodor,\" he said again. Theon Greyjoy had once commented that Hodor did not know \\nmuch, but no one could doubt that he knew his name. Old Nan had cackled like a hen when Bran told \\nher that, and confessed that Hodor\\'s real name was Walder. No one knew where \"Hodor\" had come \\nfrom, she said, but when he started saying it, they started calling him by it. It was the only word he had. \\nThey left Old Nan in the tower room with her needles and her memories. Hodor hummed tunelessly as \\nhe carried Bran down the steps and through the gallery, with Maester Luwin following behind, hurrying to \\nkeep up with the stableboy\\'s long strides. \\n  160\\n\\nRobb was seated in Father\\'s high seat, wearing ringmail and boiled leather and the stern face of Robb \\nthe Lord. Theon Greyjoy and Hallis Mollen stood behind him. A dozen guardsmen lined the grey stone \\nwalls beneath tall narrow windows. In the center of the room the dwarf stood with his servants, and four \\nstrangers in the black of the Night\\'s Watch. Bran could sense the anger in the hall the moment that Hodor \\ncarried him through the doors. \\n\"Any man of the Night\\'s Watch is welcome here at Winterfell for as long as he wishes to stay,\" Robb \\nwas saying with the voice of Robb the Lord. His sword was across his knees, the steel bare for all the \\nworld to see. Even Bran knew what it meant to greet a guest with an unsheathed sword. \\n\"Any man of the Night\\'s Watch,\" the dwarf repeated, \"but not me, do I take your meaning, boy?\" \\nRobb stood and pointed at the little man with his sword. \"I am the \\nlord here while my mother and father are away, Lannister. I am not your boy.\" \\n\"If you are a lord, you might learn a lord\\'s courtesy,\" the little man replied, ignoring the sword point in his \\nface. \"Your bastard brother has all your father\\'s graces, it would seem.\" \\n\"Jon, \" Bran gasped out from Hodor\\'s arms. \\nThe dwarf turned to look at him. \"So it is true, the boy lives. I could scarce believe it. You Starks are \\nhard to kill.\" \\n\"You Lannisters had best remember that,\" Robb said, lowering his sword. \"Hodor, bring my brother \\nhere.\" \\n\"Hodor,\" Hodor said, and he trotted forward smiling and set Bran in the high seat of the Starks, where \\nthe Lords of Winterfell had sat since the days when they called themselves the Kings in the North. The \\nseat was cold stone, polished smooth by countless bottoms; the carved heads of direwolves snarled on \\nthe ends of its massive arms. Bran clasped them as he sat, his useless legs dangling. The great seat made \\nhim feel half a baby. \\nRobb put a hand on his shoulder. \"You said you had business with Bran. Well, here he is, Lannister.\" \\nBran was uncomfortably aware of Tyrion Lannister\\'s eyes. One was black and one was green, and both \\nwere looking at him, studying him, weighing him. \"I am told you were quite the climber, Bran,\" the little \\nman said at last. \"Tell me, how is it you happened to fall that day?\" \\n\"I never,\" Bran insisted. He never fell, never never never. \\n\"The child does not remember anything of the fall, or the climb that came before it,\" said Maester Luwin \\ngently. \\n\"Curious,\" said Tyrion Lannister. \\n\"My brother is not here to answer questions, Lannister,\" Robb said curtly. \"Do your business and be on \\nyour way.\" \\n  161\\n\\n\"I have a gift for you,\" the dwarf said to Bran. \"Do you like to ride, boy?\" \\nMaester Luwin came forward. \"My lord, the child has lost the use of his legs. He cannot sit a horse.\" \\n\"Nonsense,\" said Lannister. \"With the right horse and the right saddle, even a cripple can ride.\" \\nThe word was a knife through Bran\\'s heart. He felt tears come unbidden to his eyes. \"I\\'m not a cripple!\" \\n\"Then I am not a dwarf,\" the dwarf said with a twist of his mouth. \"My father will rejoice to hear it.\" \\nGreyjoy laughed. \\n\"What sort of horse and saddle are you suggesting?\" Maester Luwin asked. \\n\"A smart horse,\" Lannister replied. \"The boy cannot use his legs to \\ncommand the animal, so you must shape the horse to the rider, teach it to respond to the reins, to the \\nvoice. I would begin with an unbroken yearling, with no old training to be unlearned.\" He drew a rolled \\npaper from his belt. \"Give this to your saddler. He will provide the rest.\" \\nMaester Luwin took the paper from the dwarfs hand, curious as a small grey squirrel. He unrolled it, \\nstudied it. \"I see. You draw nicely, my lord. Yes, this ought to work. I should have thought of this \\nmyself.\" \\n\"It came easier to me, Maester. It is not terribly unlike my own saddles.\" \\n\"Will I truly be able to ride?\" Bran asked. He wanted to believe them, but he was afraid. Perhaps it was \\njust another lie. The crow had promised him that he could fly. \\n\"You will,\" the dwarf told him. \"And I swear to you, boy, on horseback you will be as tall as any of \\nthem.\" \\nRobb Stark seemed puzzled. \"Is this some trap, Lannister? What\\'s Bran to you? Why should you want \\nto help him?\" \\n\"Your brother Jon asked it of me. And I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples and bastards and \\nbroken things.\" Tyrion Lannister placed a hand over his heart and grinned. \\nThe door to the yard flew open. Sunlight came streaming across the hall as Rickon burst in, breathless. \\nThe direwolves were with him. The boy stopped by the door, wide-eyed, but the wolves came on. Their \\neyes found Lannister, or perhaps they caught his scent. Summer began to growl first. Grey Wind picked \\nit up. They padded toward the little man, one from the right and one from the left. \\n\"The wolves do not like your smell, Lannister,\" Theon Greyioy commented. \\n\"Perhaps it\\'s time I took my leave,\" Tyrion said. He took a step backward . . . and Shaggydog came out \\nof the shadows behind him, snarling. Lannister recoiled, and Summer lunged at him from the other side. \\nHe reeled away, unsteady on his feet, and Grey Wind snapped at his arm, teeth ripping at his sleeve and \\ntearing loose a scrap of cloth. \\n  162\\n\\n\"No!\" Bran shouted from the high seat as Lannister\\'s men reached for their steel. \"Summer, here. \\nSummer, to me!\" \\nThe direwolf heard the voice, glanced at Bran, and again at Lannister. He crept backward, away from \\nthe little man, and settled down below Bran\\'s dangling feet. \\nRobb had been holding his breath. He let it out with a sigh and called, \"Grey Wind.\" His direwolf moved \\nto him, swift and silent. Now there was only Shaggydog, rumbling at the small man, his eyes burning like \\ngreen fire. \\n\"Rickon, call him,\" Bran shouted to his baby brother, and Rickon remembered himself and screamed, \\n\"Home, Shaggy, home now.\" The black wolf gave Lannister one final snarl and bounded off to Rickon, \\nwho hugged him tightly around the neck. \\nTyrion Lannister undid his scarf, mopped at his brow, and said in a flat voice, \"How interesting.\" \\n\"Are you well, my lord?\" asked one of his men, his sword in hand. He glanced nervously at the \\ndirewolves as he spoke. \\n\"My sleeve is torn and my breeches are unaccountably damp, but nothing was harmed save my dignity.\" \\nEven Robb looked shaken. \"The wolves . . . I don\\'t know why they did that . . .\" \\n\"No doubt they mistook me for dinner.\" Lannister bowed stiffly to Bran. \"I thank you for calling them off, \\nyoung ser. I promise you, they would have found me quite indigestible. And now I will be leaving, truly.\" \\n\"A moment, my lord,\" Maester Luwin said. He moved to Robb and they huddled close together, \\nwhispering. Bran tried to hear what they were saying, but their voices were too low. \\nRobb Stark finally sheathed his sword. \"I . . . I may have been hasty with you,\" he said. \"You\\'ve done \\nBran a kindness, and, well . . .\" Robb composed himself with an effort. \"The hospitality of Winterfell is \\nyours if you wish it, Lannister.\" \\n\"Spare me your false courtesies, boy. You do not love me and you do not want me here. I saw an inn \\noutside your walls, in the winter town. I\\'ll find a bed there, and both of us will sleep easier. For a few \\ncoppers I may even find a comely wench to warm the sheets for me.\" He spoke to one of the black \\nbrothers, an old man with a twisted back and a tangled beard. \"Yoren, we go south at daybreak. You \\nwill find me on the road, no doubt.\" With that he made his exit, struggling across the hall on his short legs, \\npast Rickon and out the door. His men followed. \\nThe four of the Night\\'s Watch remained. Robb turned to them uncertainly. \"I have had rooms prepared, \\nand you\\'ll find no lack of hot water to wash off the dust of the road. I hope you will honor us at table \\ntonight.\" He spoke the words so awkwardly that even Bran took note; it was a speech he had learned, \\nnot words from the heart, but the black brothers thanked him all the same. \\nSummer followed them up the tower steps as Hodor carried Bran back to his bed. Old Nan was asleep \\nin her chair. Hodor said \"Hodor,\" gathered up his great-grandmother, and carried her off, snoring softly, \\nwhile Bran lay thinking. Robb had promised that he could feast with \\n  163\\n\\nthe Night\\'s Watch in the Great Hall. \"Summer,\" he called. The wolf bounded up on the bed. Bran \\nhugged him so hard he could feel the hot breath on his cheek. \"I can ride now,\" he whispered to his \\nfriend. \"We can go hunting in the woods soon, wait and see.\" After a time he slept. \\nIn his dream he was climbing again, pulling himself up an ancient windowless tower, his fingers forcing \\nthemselves between blackened stones, his feet scrabbling for purchase. Higher and higher he climbed, \\nthrough the clouds and into the night sky, and still the tower rose before him. When he paused to look \\ndown, his head swam dizzily and he felt his fingers slipping. Bran cried out and clung for dear life. The \\nearth was a thousand miles beneath him and he could not fly. He could not fly. He waited until his heart \\nhad stopped pounding, until he could breathe, and he began to climb again. There was no way to go but \\nup. Far above him, outlined against a vast pale moon, he thought he could see the shapes of gargoyles. \\nHis arms were sore and aching, but he dared not rest. He forced himself to climb faster. The gargoyles \\nwatched him ascend. Their eyes glowed red as hot coals in a brazier. Perhaps once they had been lions, \\nbut now they were twisted and grotesque. Bran could hear them whispering to each other in soft stone \\nvoices terrible to hear. He must not listen, he told himself, he must not hear, so long as he did not hear \\nthem he was safe. But when the gargoyles pulled themselves loose from the stone and padded down the \\nside of the tower to where Bran clung, he knew he was not safe after all. \"I didn\\'t hear,\" he wept as they \\ncame closer and closer, \"I didn\\'t, I didn\\'t.\" \\nHe woke gasping, lost in darkness, and saw a vast shadow looming over him. \"I didn\\'t hear,\" he \\nwhispered, trembling in fear, but then the shadow said \"Hodor,\" and lit the candle by the bedside, and \\nBran sighed with relief. \\nHodor washed the sweat from him with a warm, damp cloth and dressed him with deft and gentle hands. \\nWhen it was time, he carried him down to the Great Hall, where a long trestle table had been set up near \\nthe fire. The lord\\'s seat at the head of the table had been left empty, but Robb sat to the right of it, with \\nBran across from him. They ate suckling pig that night, and pigeon pie, and turnips soaking in butter, and \\nafterward the cook had promised honeycombs. Summer snatched table scraps from Bran\\'s hand, while \\nGrey Wind and Shaggydog fought over a bone in the corner. Winterfell\\'s dogs would not come near the \\nhall now. Bran had found that strange at first, but he was growing used to it. \\nYoren was senior among the black brothers, so the steward had seated him between Robb and Maester \\nLuwin. The old man had a sour \\nsmell, as if he had not washed in a long time. He ripped at the meat with his teeth, cracked the ribs to \\nsuck out the marrow from the bones, and shrugged at the mention of Jon Snow. \"Ser Alliser\\'s bane,\" he \\ngrunted, and two of his companions shared a laugh that Bran did not understand. But when Robb asked \\nfor news of their uncle Benjen, the black brothers grew ominously quiet. \\n\"What is it?\" Bran asked. \\nYoren wiped his fingers on his vest. \"There\\'s hard news, m\\'lords, and a cruel way to pay you for your \\nmeat and mead, but the man as asks the question must bear the answer. Stark\\'s gone.\" \\nOne of the other men said, \"The Old Bear sent him out to look for Waymar Royce, and he\\'s late \\nreturning, my lord.\" \\n  164\\n\\n\"Too long,\" Yoren said. \"Most like he\\'s dead.\" \\n\"My uncle is not dead,\" Robb Stark said loudly, anger in his tones. He rose from the bench and laid his \\nhand on the hilt of his sword. \"Do you hear me? My uncle is not dead!\" His voice rang against the stone \\nwalls, and Bran was suddenly afraid. \\nOld sour-smelling Yoren looked up at Robb, unimpressed. \"Whatever you say, m\\'lord,\" he said. He \\nsucked at a piece of meat between his teeth. \\nThe youngest of the black brothers shifted uncomfortably in his seat. \"There\\'s not a man on the Wall \\nknows the haunted forest better than Benjen Stark. He\\'ll find his way back.\" \\n\"Well,\" said Yoren, \"maybe he will and maybe he won\\'t. Good men have gone into those woods before, \\nand never come out.\" \\nAll Bran could think of was Old Nan\\'s story of the Others and the last hero, hounded through the white \\nwoods by dead men and spiders big as hounds. He was afraid for a moment, until he remembered how \\nthat story ended. \"The children will help him,\" he blurted, \"the children of the forest!\" \\nTheon Greyjoy sniggered, and Maester Luwin said, \"Bran, the children of the forest have been dead and \\ngone for thousands of years. All that is left of them are the faces in the trees.\" \\n\"Down here, might be that\\'s true, Maester,\" Yoren said, \"but up past the Wall, who\\'s to say? Up there, a \\nman can\\'t always tell what\\'s alive and what\\'s dead.\" \\nThat night, after the plates had been cleared, Robb carried Bran up to bed himself. Grey Wind led the \\nway, and Summer came close behind. His brother was strong for his age, and Bran was as light as a \\nbundle of rags, but the stairs were steep and dark, and Robb was breathing hard by the time they \\nreached the top. \\nHe put Bran into bed, covered him with blankets, and blew out the \\ncandle. For a time Robb sat beside him in the dark. Bran wanted to talk to him, but he did not know \\nwhat to say. \"We\\'ll find a horse for you, I promise,\" Robb whispered at last. \\n\"Are they ever coming back?\" Bran asked him. \\n\"Yes,\" Robb said with such hope in his voice that Bran knew he was hearing his brother and not just \\nRobb the Lord. \"Mother will be home soon. Maybe we can ride out to meet her when she comes. \\nWouldn\\'t that surprise her, to see you ahorse?\" Even in the dark room, Bran could feel his brother\\'s \\nsmile. \"And afterward, we\\'ll ride north to see the Wall. We won\\'t even tell Jon we\\'re coming, we\\'ll just be \\nthere one day, you and me. It will be an adventure.\" \\n\"An adventure,\" Bran repeated wistfully. He heard his brother sob. The room was so dark he could not \\nsee the tears on Robb\\'s face, so he reached out and found his hand. Their fingers twined together. \\nEDDARD \\n  165\\n\\n\"Lord Arryn\\'s death was a great sadness for all of us, my lord,\" Grand Maester Pycelle said. \"I would be \\nmore than happy to tell you what I can of the manner of his passing. Do be seated. Would you care for \\nrefreshments? Some dates, perhaps? I have some very fine persimmons as well. Wine no longer agrees \\nwith my digestion, I fear, but I can offer you a cup of iced milk, sweetened with honey. I find it most \\nrefreshing in this heat.\" \\nThere was no denying the heat; Ned could feel the silk tunic clinging to his chest. Thick, moist air \\ncovered the city like a damp woolen blanket, and the riverside had grown unruly as the poor fled their \\nhot, airless warrens to jostle for sleeping places near the water, where the only breath of wind was to be \\nfound. \"That would be most kind,\" Ned said, seating himself. \\nPycelle lifted a tiny silver bell with thumb and forefinger and tinkled it gently. A slender young serving girl \\nhurried into the solar. \"Iced milk for the King\\'s Hand and myself, if you would be so kind, child. Well \\nsweetened.\" \\nAs the girl went to fetch their drinks, the Grand Maester knotted his fingers together and rested his \\nhands on his stomach. \"The smallfolk say that the last year of summer is always the hottest. It is not so, \\nyet ofttimes it feels that way, does it not? On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows.\" \\nThe heavy jeweled chain \\naround the old man\\'s neck chinked softly as he shifted in his seat. \"To be sure, King Maekar\\'s summer \\nwas hotter than this one, and near as long. There were fools, even in the Citadel, who took that to mean \\nthat the Great Summer had come at last, the summer that never ends, but in the seventh year it broke \\nsuddenly, and we had a short autumn and a terrible long winter. Still, the heat was fierce while it lasted. \\nOldtown steamed and sweltered by day and came alive only by night. We would walk in the gardens by \\nthe river and argue about the gods. I remember the smells of those nights, my lord-perfume and sweat, \\nmelons ripe to bursting, peaches and pomegranates, nightshade and moonbloom. I was a young man \\nthen, still forging my chain. The heat did not exhaust me as it does now.\" Pycelle\\'s eyes were so heavily \\nlidded he looked half-asleep. \"My pardons, Lord Eddard. You did not come to hear foolish meanderings \\nof a summer forgotten before your father was born. Forgive an old man his wanderings, if you would. \\nMinds are like swords, I do fear. The old ones go to rust. Ah, and here is our milk.\" The serving girl \\nplaced the tray between them, and Pycelle gave her a smile. \"Sweet child.\" He lifted a cup, tasted, \\nnodded. \"Thank you. You may go.\" \\nWhen the girl had taken her leave, Pycelle peered at Ned through pale, rheumy eyes. \"Now where were \\nwe? Oh, yes. You asked about Lord Arryn . . .\" \\n\"I did.\" Ned sipped politely at the iced milk. It was pleasantly cold, but oversweet to his taste. \\n\"If truth be told, the Hand had not seemed quite himself for some time,\" Pycelle said. \"We had sat \\ntogether on council many a year, he and 1, and the signs were there to read, but I put them down to the \\ngreat burdens he had borne so faithfully for so long. Those broad shoulders were weighed down by all \\nthe cares of the realm, and more besides. His son was ever sickly, and his lady wife so anxious that she \\nwould scarcely let the boy out of her sight. It was enough to weary even a strong man, and the Lord Jon \\nwas not young. Small wonder if he seemed melancholy and tired. Or so I thought at the time. Yet now I \\nam less certain.\" He gave a ponderous shake of his head. \\n\"What can you tell me of his final illness?\" \\n  166\\n\\nThe Grand Maester spread his hands in a gesture of helpless sorrow. \"He came to me one day asking \\nafter a certain book, as hale and healthy as ever, though it did seem to me that something was troubling \\nhim deeply. The next morning he was twisted over in pain, too sick to rise from bed. Maester Colemon \\nthought it was a chill on the stomach. The weather had been hot, and the Hand often iced his wine, which \\ncan upset the digestion. When Lord Jon continued to weaken, I went to him myself, but the gods did not \\ngrant me the power to save him.\" \\n\"I have heard that you sent Maester Colemon away.\" \\nThe Grand Maester\\'s nod was as slow and deliberate as a glacier. \"I did, and I fear the Lady Lysa will \\nnever forgive me that. Maybe I was wrong, but at the time I thought it best. Maester Colemon is like a \\nson to me, and I yield to none in my esteem for his abilities, but he is young, and the young ofttimes do \\nnot comprehend the frailty of an older body. He was purging Lord Arryn with wasting potions and \\npepper juice, and I feared he might kill him.\" \\n\"Did Lord Arryn say anything to you during his final hours?\" \\nPycelle wrinkled his brow. \"In the last stage of his fever, the Hand called out the name Robert several \\ntimes, but whether he was asking for his son or for the king I could not say. Lady Lysa would not permit \\nthe boy to enter the sickroom, for fear that he too might be taken ill. The king did come, and he sat \\nbeside the bed for hours, talking and joking of times long past in hopes of raising Lord Jon\\'s spirits. His \\nlove was fierce to see.\" \\n\"Was there nothing else? No final words?\" \\n\"When I saw that all hope had fled, I gave the Hand the milk of the poppy, so he should not suffer. Just \\nbefore he closed his eyes for the last time, he whispered something to the king and his lady wife, a \\nblessing for his son. The seed is strong, he said. At the end, his speech was too slurred to comprehend. \\nDeath did not come until the next morning, but Lord Jon was at peace after that. He never spoke again.\" \\nNed took another swallow of milk, trying not to gag on the sweetness of it. \"Did it seem to you that there \\nwas anything unnatural about Lord Arryn\\'s death?\" \\n\"Unnatural?\" The aged maester\\'s voice was thin as a whisper. \"No, I could not say so. Sad, for a \\ncertainty. Yet in its own way, death is the most natural thing of all, Lord Eddard. Jon Arryn rests easy \\nnow, his burdens lifted at last.\" \\n\"This illness that took him,\" said Ned. \"Had you ever seen its like before, in other men?\" \\n\"Near forty years I have been Grand Maester of the Seven Kingdoms,\" Pycelle replied. \"Under our \\ngood King Robert, and Aerys Targaryen before him, and his father Jaehaerys the Second before him, \\nand even for a few short months under Jaehaerys\\'s father, Aegon the Fortunate, the Fifth of His Name. I \\nhave seen more of illness than I care to remember, my lord. I will tell you this: Every case is different, and \\nevery case is alike. Lord Jon\\'s death was no stranger than any other.\" \\n224 GEORGE RA. MARTIN \\n  167\\n\\n\"His wife thought otherwise.\" \\nThe Grand Maester nodded. \"I recall now, the widow is sister to your own noble wife. If an old man \\nmay be forgiven his blunt speech, let me say that grief can derange even the strongest and most \\ndisciplined of minds, and the Lady Lysa was never that. Since her last stillbirth, she has seen enemies in \\nevery shadow, and the death of her lord husband left her shattered and lost.\" \\n\"So you are quite certain that Jon Arryn died of a sudden illness?\" \\n\"I am,\" Pycelle replied gravely. \"If not illness, my good lord, what else could it be?\" \\n\"Poison,\" Ned suggested quietly. \\nPycelle\\'s sleepy eyes flicked open. The aged maester shifted uncomfortably in his seat. \"A disturbing \\nthought. We are not the Free Cities, where such things are common. Grand Maester Aethelmure wrote \\nthat all men carry murder in their hearts, yet even so, the poisoner is beneath contempt.\" He fell silent for \\na moment, his eyes lost in thought. \"What you suggest is possible, my lord, yet I do not think it likely. \\nEvery hedge maester knows the common poisons, and Lord Arryn displayed none of the signs. And the \\nHand was loved by all. What sort of monster in man\\'s flesh would dare to murder such a noble lord?\" \\n\"I have heard it said that poison is a woman\\'s weapon.\" \\nPycelle stroked his beard thoughtfully. \"It is said. Women, cravens . . . and eunuchs.\" He cleared his \\nthroat and spat a thick glob of phelm onto the rushes. Above them, a raven cawed loudly in the rookery. \\n\"The Lord Varys was born a slave in Lys, did you know? Put not your trust in spiders, my lord.\" \\nThat was scarcely anything Ned needed to be told; there was something about Varys that made his flesh \\ncrawl. \"I will remember that, Maester. And I thank you for your help. I have taken enough of your time.\" \\nHe stood. \\nGrand Maester Pycelle pushed himself up from his chair slowly and escorted Ned to the door. \"I hope I \\nhave helped in some small way to put your mind at ease. If there is any other service I might perform, you \\nneed only ask.\" \\n\"One thing,\" Ned told him. \"I should be curious to examine the book that you lent Jon the day before he \\nfell ill.\" \\n\"I fear you would find it of little interest,\" Pycelle said. \"It was a ponderous tome by Grand Maester \\nMalleon on the lineages of the great houses.\" \\n\"Still, I should like to see it.\" \\nThe old man opened the door. \"As you wish. I have it here some- \\nA GAML OF THRONLS 225 \\nwhere. When I find it, I shall have it sent to your chambers straightaway.,, \\n\"You have been most courteous,\" Ned told him. Then, almost as an afterthought, he said, \"One last \\nquestion, if you would be so kind. You mentioned that the king was at Lord Arryn\\'s bedside when he \\ndied. I wonder, was the queen with him?\" \\n  168\\n\\n\"Why, no,\" Pycelle said. \"She and the children were making the journey to Casterly Rock, in company \\nwith her father. Lord Tywin had brought a retinue to the city for the tourney on Prince Joffrey\\'s name \\nday, no doubt hoping to see his son Jaime win the champion\\'s crown. In that he was sadly disappointed. \\nIt fell to me to send the queen word of Lord Arryn\\'s sudden death. Never have I sent off a bird with a \\nheavier heart.\" \\n\"Dark wings, dark words,\" Ned murmured. It was a proverb Old Nan had taught him as a boy. \\n\"So the fishwives say,\" Grand Maester Pycelle agreed, \"but we know it is not always so. When Maester \\nLuwin\\'s bird brought the word about your Bran, the message lifted every true heart in the castle, did it \\nnot?\" \\n\"As you say, Maester.\" \\n\"The gods are merciful.\" Pycelle bowed his head. \"Come to me as often as you like, Lord Eddard. I am \\nhere to serve.\" \\nYes, Ned thought as the door swung shut, but whom? \\nOn the way back to his chambers, he came upon his daughter Arya on the winding steps of the Tower \\nof the Hand, windmilling her arms as she struggled to balance on one leg. The rough stone had scuffed \\nher bare feet. Ned stopped and looked at her. \"Arya, what are you doing?\" \\n\"Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.\" Her hands flailed at the air to steady herself. \\nNed had to smile. \"Which toe?\" he teased. \\n\"Any toe,\" Arya said, exasperated with the question. She hopped from her right leg to her left, swaying \\ndangerously before she regained her balance. \\n\"Must you do your standing here?\" he asked. \"It\\'s a long hard fall down these steps.\" \\n\"Syrio says a water dancer never falls.\" She lowered her leg to stand on two feet. \"Father, will Bran \\ncome and live with us now?\" \\n\"Not for a long time, sweet one,\" he told her. \"He needs to win his strength back.\" \\nArya bit her lip. \"What will Bran do when he\\'s of age?\" \\nNed knelt beside her. \"He has years to find that answer, Arya. For \\nnow, it is enough to know that he will live.\" The night the bird had come from Winterfell, Eddard Stark \\nhad taken the girls to the castle godswood, an acre of elm and alder and black cottonwood overlooking \\nthe river. The heart tree there was a great oak, its ancient limbs overgrown with smokeberry vines; they \\nknelt before it to offer their thanksgiving, as if it had been a weirwood. Sansa drifted to sleep as the moon \\nrose, Arya several hours later, curling up in the grass under Ned\\'s cloak. All through the dark hours he \\nkept his vigil alone. When dawn broke over the city, the dark red blooms of dragon\\'s breath surrounded \\nthe girls where they lay. \"I dreamed of Bran,\" Sansa had whispered to him. \"I saw him smiling.\" \\n  169\\n\\n\"He was going to be a knight,\" Arya was saying now. \"A knight of the Kingsguard. Can he still be a \\nknight?\" \\n\"No,\" Ned said. He saw no use in lying to her. \"Yet someday he may be the lord of a great holdfast and \\nsit on the king\\'s council. He might raise castles like Brandon the Builder, or sail a ship across the Sunset \\nSea, or enter your mother\\'s Faith and become the High Septon.\" But he will never run beside his wolf \\nagain, he thought with a sadness too deep for words, or lie with a woman, or hold his own son in his \\narms. \\nArya cocked her head to one side. \"Can I be a king\\'s councillor and build castles and become the High \\nSepton?\" \\n\"You,\" Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow, \"will marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will \\nbe knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon.\" \\nArya screwed up her face. \"No,\" she said, \"that\\'s Sansa.\" She folded up her right leg and resumed her \\nbalancing. Ned sighed and left her there. \\nInside his chambers, he stripped off his sweat-stained silks and sluiced cold water over his head from the \\nbasin beside the bed. Alyn entered as he was drying his face. \"My lord,\" he said, \"Lord Baelish is without \\nand begs audience.\" \\n\"Escort him to my solar,\" Ned said, reaching for a fresh tunic, the lightest linen he could find. \"I\\'ll see him \\nat once.\" \\nLittlefinger was perched on the window seat when Ned entered, watching the knights of the Kingsguard \\npractice at swords in the yard below. \"If only old Selmy\\'s mind were as nimble as his blade,\" he said \\nwistfully, \"our council meetings would be a good deal livelier.\" \\n\"Ser Barristan is as valiant and honorable as any man in King\\'s Landing.\" Ned had come to have a deep \\nrespect for the aged, whitehaired Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. \\n\"And as tiresome,\" Littlefinger added, \"though I daresay he should \\ndo well in the tourney. Last year he unhorsed the Hound, and it was only four years ago that he was \\nchampion.\" \\nThe question of who might win the tourney interested Eddard Stark not in the least. \"Is there a reason for \\nthis visit, Lord Petyr, or are you here simply to enjoy the view from my window?\" \\nLittlefinger smiled. \"I promised Cat I would help you in your inquiries, and so I have.\" \\nThat took Ned aback. Promise or no promise, he could not find it in him to trust Lord Petyr Baelish, \\nwho struck him as too clever by half. \"You have something for me?\" \\n\"Someone,\" Littlefinger corrected. \"Four someones, if truth be told. Had you thought to question the \\nHand\\'s servants?\" \\n  170\\n\\nNed frowned. \"Would that I could. Lady Arryn took her household back to the Eyrie.\" Lysa had done \\nhim no favor in that regard. All those who had stood closest to her husband had gone with her when she \\nfled: Jon\\'s maester, his steward, the captain of his guard, his knights and retainers. \\n\"Most of her household,\" Littlefinger said, \"not all. A few remain. A pregnant kitchen girl hastily wed to \\none of Lord Renly\\'s grooms, a stablehand who joined the City Watch, a potboy discharged from service \\nfor theft, and Lord Arryn\\'s squire.\" \\n\"His squire?\" Ned was pleasantly surprised. A man\\'s squire often knew a great deal of his comings and \\ngoings. \\n\"Ser Hugh of the Vale,\" Littlefinger named him. \"The king knighted the boy after Lord Arryn\\'s death.\" \\n\"I shall send for him,\" Ned said. \"And the others.\" \\nLittlefinger winced. \"My lord, step over here to the window, if you would be so kind.\" \\n\"Why?\" \\n\"Come, and I\\'ll show you, my lord.\" \\nFrowning, Ned crossed to the window. Petyr Baelish made a casual gesture. \"There, across the yard, at \\nthe door of the armory, do you see the boy squatting by the steps honing a sword with an oilstone?\" \\n\"What of him?\" \\n\"He reports to Varys. The Spider has taken a great interest in you and all your doings.\" He shifted in the \\nwindow seat. \"Now glance at the wall. Farther west, above the stables. The guardsman leaning on the \\nramparts?\" \\nNed saw the man. \"Another of the eunuch\\'s whisperers?\" \\n\"No, this one belongs to the queen. Notice that he enjoys a fine view of the door to this tower, the better \\nto note who calls on you. \\nThere are others, many unknown even to me. The Red Keep is full of eyes. Why do you think I hid Cat \\nin a brothel?\" \\nEddard Stark had no taste for these intrigues. \"Seven hells,\" he swore. It did seem as though the man on \\nthe wahs was watching him. Suddenly uncomfortable, Ned moved away from the window. \"Is everyone \\nsomeone\\'s informer in this cursed city?\" \\n\"Scarcely,\" said Littlefinger. He counted on the fingers on his hand. \"Why, there\\'s me, you, the king . . . \\nalthough, come to think on it, the king tells the queen much too much, and I\\'m less than certain about \\nyou.\" He stood up. \"Is there a man in your service that you trust utterly and completely?\" \\n\"Yes,\" said Ned. \\n\"In that case, I have a delightful palace in Valyria that I would dearly love to sell you,\" Littlefinger said \\n  171\\n\\nwith a mocking smile. \"The wiser answer was no, my lord, but be that as it may. Send this paragon of \\nyours to Ser Hugh and the others. Your own comings and goings will be noted, but even Varys the \\nSpider cannot watch every man in your service every hour of the day.\" He started for the door. \\n\"Lord Petyr,\" Ned called after him. \"I . . . am grateful for your help. Perhaps I was wrong to distrust \\nyou.\" \\nLittlefinger fingered his small pointed beard. \"You are slow to learn, Lord Eddard. Distrusting me was \\nthe wisest thing you\\'ve done since you climbed down off your horse.\" \\nJON \\nJon was showing Dareon how best to deliver a sidestroke when the new recruit entered the practice \\nyard. \"Your feet should be farther apart,\" he urged. \"You don\\'t want to lose your balance. That\\'s good. \\nNow pivot as you deliver the stroke, get all your weight behind the blade.\" \\nDareon broke off and lifted his visor. \"Seven gods,\" he murmured. \"Would you look at this, Jon.\" \\nJon turned. Through the eye slit of his helm, he beheld the fattest boy he had ever seen standing in the \\ndoor of the armory. By the look of him, he must have weighed twenty stone. The fur collar of his \\nembroidered surcoat was lost beneath his chins. Pale eyes moved nervously in a great round moon of a \\nface, and plump sweaty fingers wiped themselves on the velvet of his doublet. \"They . . . they told me I \\nwas to come here for . . . for training,\" he said to no one in particular. \\n\"A lordling,\" Pyp observed to Jon. \"Southron, most like near Highgarden.\" Pyp had traveled the Seven \\nKingdoms with a mummers\\' troupe, and bragged that he could tell what you were and where you\\'d been \\nborn just from the sound of your voice. \\nA striding huntsman had been worked in scarlet thread upon the breast of the fat boy\\'s fur-trimmed \\nsurcoat. Jon did not recognize the sigil. Ser Alliser Thorne looked over his new charge and said, \"It \\nwould seem they have run short of poachers and thieves down south. \\nNow they send us pigs to man the Wall. Is fur and velvet your notion of armor, my Lord of Ham?\" \\nIt was soon revealed that the new recruit had brought his own armor with him; padded doublet, boiled \\nleather, mail and plate and helm, even a great wood-and-leather shield blazoned with the same striding \\nhuntsman he wore on his surcoat. As none of it was black, however, Ser Alliser insisted that he reequip \\nhimself from the armory. That took half the morning. His girth required Donal Noye to take apart a mail \\nhauberk and refit it with leather panels at the sides. To get a helm over his head the armorer had to \\ndetach the visor. His leathers bound so tightly around his legs and under his arms that he could scarcely \\nmove. Dressed for battle, the new boy looked like an overcooked sausage about to burst its skin. \"Let us \\nhope you are not as inept as you look,\" Ser Alliser said. \"Halder, see what Ser Piggy can do.\" \\nJon Snow winced. Halder had been born in a quarry and apprenticed as a stonemason. He was sixteen, \\ntall and muscular, and his blows were as hard as any Jon had ever felt. \"This will be uglier than a whore\\'s \\nass,\" Pyp muttered, and it was. \\n  172\\n\\nThe fight lasted less than a minute before the fat boy was on the ground, his whole body shaking as \\nblood leaked through his shattered helm and between his pudgy fingers. \"I yield,\" he shrilled. \"No more, I \\nyield, don\\'t hit me.\" Rast and some of the other boys were laughing. \\nEven then, Ser Alliser would not call an end. \"On your feet, Ser Piggy,\" he called. \"Pick up your sword.\" \\nWhen the boy continued to cling to the ground, Thorne gestured to Halder. \"Hit him with the flat of your \\nblade until he finds his feet.\" Halder delivered a tentative smack to his foe\\'s upraised cheeks. \"You can hit \\nharder than that,\" Thorne taunted. Halder took hold of his longsword with both hands and brought it \\ndown so hard the blow split leather, even on the flat. The new boy screeched in pain. \\nJon Snow took a step forward. Pyp laid a mailed hand on his arm. \"Jon, no,\" the small boy whispered \\nwith an anxious glance at Ser Alliser Thorne. \\n\"On your feet,\" Thorne repeated. The fat boy struggled to rise, slipped, and fell heavily again. \"Ser Piggy \\nis starting to grasp the notion,\" Ser Alliser observed. \"Again.\" \\nHalder lifted the sword for another blow. \"Cut us off a ham!\" Rast urged, laughing. \\nJon shook off Pyp\\'s hand. \"Halder, enough.\" \\nHalder looked to Ser Alliser. \\n\"The Bastard speaks and the peasants tremble,\" the master-at-arms \\nsaid in that sharp, cold voice of his. \"I remind you that I am the master-at-arms here, Lord Snow.\" \\n\"Look at him, Haider,\" Jon urged, ignoring Thorne as best he could. \"There\\'s no honor in beating a fallen \\nfoe. He yielded.\" He knelt beside the fat boy. \\nHaider lowered his sword. \"He yielded,\" he echoed. \\nSer Alliser\\'s onyx eyes were fixed on Jon Snow. \"It would seem our Bastard is in love,\" he said as Jon \\nhelped the fat boy to his feet. \"Show me your steel, Lord Snow.\" \\nJon drew his longsword. He dared defy Ser Alliser only to a point, and he feared he was well beyond it \\nnow. \\nThorne smiled. \"The Bastard wishes to defend his lady love, so we shall make an exercise of it. Rat, \\nPimple, help our Stone Head here.\" Rast and Albett moved to join Haider. \"Three of you ought to be \\nsufficient to make Lady Piggy squeal. All you need do is get past the Bastard.\" \\n\"Stay behind me,\" Jon said to the fat boy. Ser Alliser had often sent two foes against him, but never \\nthree. He knew he would likely go to sleep bruised and bloody tonight. He braced himself for the assault. \\nSuddenly Pyp was beside him. \"Three to two will make for better sport,\" the small boy said cheerfully. \\nHe dropped his visor and slid out his sword. Before Jon could even think to protest, Grenn had stepped \\nup to make a third. \\nThe yard had grown deathly quiet. Jon could feel Ser Alliser\\'s eyes. \"Why are you waiting?\" he asked \\n  173\\n\\nRast and the others in a voice gone deceptively soft, but it was Jon who moved first. Haider barely got \\nhis sword up in time. \\nJon drove him backward, attacking with every blow, keeping the older boy on the heels. Know your \\nfoe, Ser Rodrik had taught him once; Jon knew Haider, brutally strong but short of patience, with no \\ntaste for defense. Frustrate him, and he would leave himself open, as certain as sunset. \\nThe clang of steel echoed through the yard as the others joined battle around him. Jon blocked a savage \\ncut at his head, the shock of impact running up his arm as the swords crashed together. He slammed a \\nsidestroke into Haider\\'s ribs, and was rewarded with a muffled grunt of pain. The counterstroke caught \\nJon on the shoulder. Chainmail crunched, and pain flared up his neck, but for an instant Haider was \\nunbalanced. Jon cut his left leg from under him, and he fell with a curse and a crash. \\nGrenn was standing his ground as Jon had taught him, giving Albett more than he cared for, but Pyp was \\nhard-pressed. Rast had two years \\n232 \\nGEORGE R.R. MARTIN \\nand forty pounds on him. Jon stepped up behind him and rang the raper\\'s helm like a bell. As Rast went \\nreeling, Pyp slid in under his guard, knocked him down, and leveled a blade at his throat. By then Jon \\nhad moved on. Facing two swords, Albett backed away. \"I yield,\" he shouted. \\nSer Alliser Thorne surveyed the scene with disgust. \"The mummer\\'s farce has gone on long enough for \\ntoday.\" He walked away. The session was at an end. \\nDareon helped Halder to his feet. The quarryman\\'s son wrenched off his helm and threw it across the \\nyard. \"For an instant, I thought I finally had you, Snow.\" \\n\"For an instant, you did,\" Jon replied. Under his mail and leather, his shoulder was throbbing. He \\nsheathed his sword and tried to remove his helm, but when he raised his arm, the pain made him grit his \\nteeth. \\n\"Let me,\" a voice said. Thick-fingered hands unfastened helm from gorget and lifted it off gently. \"Did he \\nhurt you?\" \\n\"I\\'ve been bruised before.\" He touched his shoulder and winced. The yard was emptying around them. \\nBlood matted the fat boy\\'s hair where Halder had split his helm asunder. \"My name is Samwell Tarly, of \\nHorn . . .\" He stopped and licked his lips. \"I mean, I was of Horn Hill, until I . . . left. I\\'ve come to take \\nthe black. My father is Lord Randyll, a bannerman to the \\nTyrells of Highgarden. I used to be his heir, only His voice \\ntrailed off. \\n\"I\\'m Jon Snow, Ned Stark\\'s bastard, of Winterfell.\" \\nSamwell Tarly nodded. \"I \\n  174\\n\\nMy mother calls me Sam.\" \\n\"You can call him Lord Snow,\" Pyp said as he came up to join them. \"You don\\'t want to know what his \\nmother calls him.\" \\n\"These two are Grenn and Pypar,\" Jon said. \\n\"Grenn\\'s the ugly one,\" Pyp said. \\nGrenn scowled. \"You\\'re uglier than me. At least I don\\'t have ears like a bat.\" \\n\"My thanks to all of you,\" the fat boy said gravely. \\n\"Why didn\\'t you get up and fight?\" Grenn demanded. \\n\"I wanted to, truly. I just . . . I couldn\\'t. I didn\\'t want him to hit me anymore.\" He looked at the ground. \\n\"I \\nMy lord father always said so.\" \\nGrenn looked thunderstruck. Even Pyp had no words to say to that, and Pyp had words for everything. \\nWhat sort of man would proclaim himself a coward? \\nSamwell Tarly must have read their thoughts on their faces. His eyes \\n. if you want, you can call me Sam. \\nI fear I\\'m a coward. \\nmet Jon\\'s and darted away, quick as frightened animals. \"I ... I\\'m sorry,\" he said. \"I don\\'t mean to . . . to \\nbe like I am.\" He walked heavily toward the armory. \\nJon called after him. \"You were hurt,\" he said. \"Tomorrow you\\'ll do better.\" \\nSam looked mournfully back over one shoulder. \"No I won\\'t,\" he said, blinking back tears. \"I never do \\nbetter.\" \\nWhen he was gone, Grenn frowned. \"Nobody likes cravens,\" he said uncomfortably. \"I wish we hadn\\'t \\nhelped him. What if they think we\\'re craven too?\" \\n\"You\\'re too stupid to be craven,\" Pyp told him. \\n\"I am not,\" Grenn said. \\n\"Yes you are. If a bear attacked you in the woods, you\\'d be too stupid to run away.\" \\n\"I would not,\" Grenn insisted. \"I\\'d run away faster than you.\" He stopped suddenly, scowling when he \\nsaw Pyp\\'s grin and realized what he\\'d just said. His thick neck flushed a dark red. Jon left them there \\narguing as he returned to the armory, hung up his sword, and stripped off his battered armor. \\n  175\\n\\nLife at Castle Black followed certain patterns; the mornings were for swordplay, the afternoons for \\nwork. The black brothers set new recruits to many different tasks, to learn where their skills lay. Jon \\ncherished the rare afternoons when he was sent out with Ghost ranging at his side to bring back game for \\nthe Lord Commander\\'s table, but for every day spent hunting, he gave a dozen to Donal Noye in the \\narmory, spinning the whetstone while the one-armed smith sharpened axes grown dull from use, or \\npumping the bellows as Noye hammered out a new sword. Other times he ran messages, stood at guard, \\nmucked out stables, fletched arrows, assisted Maester Aemon with his birds or Bowen Marsh with his \\ncounts and inventories. \\nThat afternoon, the watch commander sent him to the winch cage with four barrels of fresh-crushed \\nstone, to scatter gravel over the icy footpaths atop the Wall. It was lonely and boring work, even with \\nGhost along for company, but Jon found he did not mind. On a clear day you could see half the world \\nfrom the top of the Wall, and the air was always cold and bracing. He could think here, and he found \\nhimself thinking of Samwell Tarly . . . and, oddly, of Tyrion Lannister. He wondered what Tyrion would \\nhave made of the fat boy. Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it, the dwarf had told him, \\ngrinning. The world was full of cravens who pretended to be heroes; it took a queer sort of courage to \\nadmit to cowardice as Samwell Tarly had. \\nHis sore shoulder made the work go slowly. It was late afternoon before Jon finished graveling the \\npaths. He lingered on high to watch the sun go down, turning the western sky the color of blood. Finally, \\nas dusk was settling over the north, Jon rolled the empty barrels back into the cage and signaled the \\nwinch men to lower him. \\nThe evening meal was almost done by the time he and Ghost reached the common hall. A group of the \\nblack brothers were dicing over mulled wine near the fire. His friends were at the bench nearest the west \\nwall, laughing. Pyp was in the middle of a story. The mummer\\'s boy with the big ears was a born liar with \\na hundred different voices, and he did not tell his tales so much as live them, playing all the parts as \\nneeded, a king one moment and a swineherd the next. When he turned into an alehouse girl or a virgin \\nprincess, he used a high falsetto voice that reduced them all to tears of helpless laughter, and his eunuchs \\nwere always eerily accurate caricatures of Ser Alliser. Jon took as much pleasure from Pyp\\'s antics as \\nanyone . . . yet that night he turned away and went instead to the end of the bench, where Samwell Tarly \\nsat alone, as far from the others as he could get. \\nHe was finishing the last of the pork pie the cooks had served up for supper when Jon sat down across \\nfrom him. The fat boy\\'s eyes widened at the sight of Ghost. \"Is that a wolf?\" \\n\"A direwolf,\" Jon said. \"His name is Ghost. The direwolf is the sigil of my father\\'s House.\" \\n\"Ours is a striding huntsman,\" Samwell Tarly said. \\n\"Do you like to hunt?\" \\nThe fat boy shuddered. \"I hate it.\" He looked as though he was going to cry again. \\n\"What\\'s wrong now?\" Jon asked him. \"Why are you always so frightened?\" \\nSam stared at the last of his pork pie and gave a feeble shake of his head, too scared even to talk. A \\nburst of laughter filled the hall. Jon heard Pyp squeaking in a high voice. He stood. \"Let\\'s go outside.\" \\n  176\\n\\nThe round fat face looked up at him, suspicious. \"Why? What will we do outside?\" \\n\"Talk,\" Jon said. \"Have you seen the Wall?\" \\n\"I\\'m fat, not blind,\" Samwell Tarly said. \"Of course I saw it, it\\'s seven hundred feet high.\" Yet he stood \\nup all the same, wrapped a furlined cloak over his shoulders, and followed Jon from the common hall, still \\nwary, as if he suspected some cruel trick was waiting for him in the night. Ghost padded along beside \\nthem. \"I never thought it would be like this,\" Sam said as they walked, his words steaming in the \\nA GAML OF THRONFS 235 \\ncold air. Already he was huffing and puffing as he tried to keep up. \"All the buildings are falling down, \\nand it\\'s so . . . so . . .\" \\n\"Cold?\" A hard frost was settling over the castle, and Jon could hear the soft crunch of grey weeds \\nbeneath his boots. \\nSam nodded miserably. \"I hate the cold,\" he said. \"Last night I woke up in the dark and the fire had gone \\nout and I was certain I was going to freeze to death by morning.\" \\n\"It must have been warmer where you come from.\" \\n\"I never saw snow until last month. We were crossing the barrowlands, me and the men my father sent \\nto see me north, and this white stuff began to fall, like a soft rain. At first I thought it was so beautiful, like \\nfeathers drifting from the sky, but it kept on and on, until I was frozen to the bone. The men had crusts of \\nsnow in their beards and more on their shoulders, and still it kept coming. I was afraid it would never \\nend.\" \\nJon smiled. \\nThe Wall loomed before them, glimmering palely in the light of the half moon. In the sky above, the stars \\nburned clear and sharp. \"Are they going to make me go up there?\" Sam asked. His face curdled like old \\nmilk as he looked at the great wooden stairs. \"I\\'ll die if I have to climb that.\" \\n\"There\\'s a winch,\" Jon said, pointing. \"They can draw you up in a cage.\" \\nSamwell Tarly sniffled. \"I don\\'t like high places.\" \\nIt was too much. Jon frowned, incredulous. \"Are you afraid of everything?\" he asked. \"I don\\'t \\nunderstand. If you are truly so craven, why are you here? Why would a coward want to join the Night\\'s \\nWatch?\" \\nSamwell Tarly looked at him for a long moment, and his round face seemed to cave in on itself. He sat \\ndown on the frost-covered ground and began to cry, huge choking sobs that made his whole body \\nshake. Jon Snow could only stand and watch. Like the snowfall on the barrowlands, it seemed the tears \\nwould never end. \\nIt was Ghost who knew what to do. Silent as shadow, the pale direwolf moved closer and began to lick \\nthe warm tears off Samwell Tarly\\'s face. The fat boy cried out, startled . . . and somehow, in a heartbeat, \\nhis sobs turned to laughter. \\n  177\\n\\nJon Snow laughed with him. Afterward they sat on the frozen ground, huddled in their cloaks with Ghost \\nbetween them. Jon told the story of how he and Robb had found the pups newborn in the late summer \\nsnows. It seemed a thousand years ago now. Before long he found himself talking of Winterfell. \\n\"Sometimes I dream about it,\" he said. \"I\\'m walking down this long empty hall. My voice echoes all \\naround, but no one answers, so I walk faster, opening doors, shouting names. I don\\'t even know who I\\'m \\nlooking for. Most nights it\\'s my father, but sometimes it\\'s Robb instead, or my little sister Arya, or my \\nuncle.\" The thought of Benjen Stark saddened him; his uncle was still missing. The Old Bear had sent out \\nrangers in search of him. Ser Jaremy Rykker had led two sweeps, and Quorin Halfhand had gone forth \\nfrom the Shadow Tower, but they\\'d found nothing aside from a few blazes in the trees that his uncle had \\nleft to mark his way. In the stony highlands to the northwest, the marks stopped abruptly and all trace of \\nBen Stark vanished. \\n\"Do you ever find anyone in your dream?\" Sam asked. \\nJon shook his head. \"No one. The castle is always empty.\" He had never told anyone of the dream, and \\nhe did not understand why he was telling Sam now, yet somehow it felt good to talk of it. \"Even the \\nravens are gone from the rookery, and the stables are full of bones. That always scares me. I start to run \\nthen, throwing open doors, climbing the tower three steps at a time, screaming for someone, for anyone. \\nAnd then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts. It\\'s black inside, and I can see the steps spiraling \\ndown. Somehow I know I have to go down there, but I don\\'t want to. I\\'m afraid of what might be \\nwaiting for me. The old Kings of Winter are down there, sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their \\nfeet and iron swords across their laps, but it\\'s not them I\\'m afraid of. I scream that I\\'m not a Stark, that \\nthis isn\\'t my place, but it\\'s no good, I have to go anyway, so I start down, feeling the walls as I descend, \\nwith no torch to light the way. It gets darker and darker, until I want to scream.\" He stopped, frowning, \\nembarrassed. \"That\\'s when I always wake.\" His skin cold and clammy, shivering in the darkness of his \\ncell. Ghost would leap up beside him, his warmth as comforting as daybreak. He would go back to sleep \\nwith his face pressed into the direwolf s shaggy white fur. \"Do you dream of Horn Hill?\" Jon asked. \\n\"No.\" Sam\\'s mouth grew tight and hard. \"I hated it there.\" He scratched Ghost behind the ear, brooding, \\nand Jon let the silence breathe. After a long while Samwell Tarly began to talk, and Jon Snow listened \\nquietly, and learned how it was that a self-confessed coward found himself on the Wall. \\nThe Tarlys were a family old in honor, bannermen to Mace Tyrell, Lord of Highgarden and Warden of \\nthe South. The eldest son of Lord Randyll Tarly, Samwell was born heir to rich lands, a strong keep, and \\na storied two-handed greatsword named Heartsbane, forged of \\nValyrian steel and passed down from father to son near five hundred years. \\nWhatever pride his lord father might have felt at Samwell\\'s birth vanished as the boy grew up plump, \\nsoft, and awkward. Sam loved to listen to music and make his own songs, to wear soft velvets, to play in \\nthe castle kitchen beside the cooks, drinking in the rich smells as he snitched lemon cakes and blueberry \\ntarts. His passions were books and kittens and dancing, clumsy as he was. But he grew ill at the sight of \\nblood, and wept to see even a chicken slaughtered. A dozen mastersat-arms came and went at Horn \\nHill, trying to turn Samwell into the knight his father wanted. The boy was cursed and caned, slapped and \\nstarved. One man had him sleep in his chainmail to make him more martial. Another dressed him in his \\n  178\\n\\nmother\\'s clothing and paraded him through the bailey to shame him into valor. He only grew fatter and \\nmore frightened, until Lord Randyll\\'s disappointment turned to anger and then to loathing. \"One time,\" \\nSam confided, his voice dropping from a whisper, \"two men came to the castle, warlocks from Qarth \\nwith white skin and blue lips. They slaughtered a bull aurochs and made me bathe in the hot blood, but it \\ndidn\\'t make me brave as they\\'d promised. I got sick and retched. Father had them scourged.\" \\nFinally, after three girls in as many years, Lady Tarly gave her lord husband a second son. From that \\nday, Lord Randyll ignored Sam, devoting all his time to the younger boy, a fierce, robust child more to \\nhis liking. Samwell had known several years of sweet peace with his music and his books. \\nUntil The dawn of his fifteenth name day, when he had been awakened to find his horse saddled and \\nready. Three men-at-arms had escorted him into a wood near Horn Hill, where his father was skinning a \\ndeer. \"You are almost a man grown now, and my heir,\" Lord Randyll Tarly had told his eldest son, his \\nlong knife laying bare the carcass as he spoke. \"You have given me no cause to disown you, but neither \\nwill I allow you to inherit the land and title that should be Dickon\\'s. Heartsbane must go to a man strong \\nenough to wield her, and you are not worthy to touch her hilt. So I have decided that you shall this day \\nannounce that you wish to take the black. You will forsake all claim to your brother\\'s inheritance and \\nstart north before evenfall. \\n\"If you do not, then on the morrow we shall have a hunt, and somewhere in these woods your horse will \\nstumble, and you will be thrown from the saddle to die . . . or so I will tell your mother. She has a \\nwoman\\'s heart and finds it in her to cherish even you, and I have no wish to cause her pain. Please do not \\nimagine that it will truly be \\nthat easy, should you think to defy me. Nothing would please me more than to hunt you down like the \\npig you are.\" His arms were red to the elbow as he laid the skinning knife aside. \"So. There is your \\nchoice. The Night\\'s Watch\"-he reached inside the deer, ripped out its heart, and held it in his fist, red and \\ndripping-\"or this.\" \\nSam told the tale in a calm, dead voice, as if it were something that had happened to someone else, not \\nto him. And strangely, Jon thought, he did not weep, not even once. When he was done, they sat \\ntogether and listened to the wind for a time. There was no other sound in all the world. \\nFinally Jon said, \"We should go back to the common hall.\" \\n\"Why?\" Sam asked. \\nJon shrugged. \"There\\'s hot cider to drink, or mulled wine if you prefer. Some nights Dareon sings for us, \\nif the mood is on him. He was a singer, before . . . well, not truly, but almost, an apprentice singer.\" \\n\"How did he come here?\" Sam asked. \\n\"Lord Rowan of Goldengrove found him in bed with his daughter. The girl was two years older, and \\nDareon swears she helped him through her window, but under her father\\'s eye she named it rape, so here \\nhe is. When Maester Aemon heard him sing, he said his voice was honey poured over thunder.\" Jon \\nsmiled. \"Toad sometimes sings too, if you call it singing. Drinking songs he learned in his father\\'s winesink. \\nPyp says his voice is piss poured over a fart.\" They laughed at that together. \\n\"I should like to hear them both,\" Sam admitted, \"but they would not want me there.\" His face was \\n  179\\n\\ntroubled. \"He\\'s going to make me fight again on the morrow, isn\\'t he?\" \\n\"He is,\" Jon was forced to say. \\nSam got awkwardly to his feet. \"I had better try to sleep.\" He huddled down in his cloak and plodded \\noff. \\nThe others were still in the common room when Jon returned, alone but for Ghost. \"Where haveyou \\nbeen?\" Pyp asked. \\n\"Talking with Sam,\" he said. \\n\"He truly is craven,\" said Grenn. \"At supper, there were still places on the bench when he got his pie, but \\nhe was too scared to come sit with us.\" \\n\"The Lord of Ham thinks he\\'s too good to eat with the likes of us,\" suggested Jeren. \\n\"I saw him eat a pork pie,\" Toad said, smirking. \"Do you think it was a brother?\" He began to make \\noinking noises. \\n\"Stop it!\" Jon snapped angrily. \\nThe other boys fell silent, taken aback by his sudden fury. \"Listen to \\nme,\" Jon said into the quiet, and he told them how it was going to be. Pyp backed him, as he\\'d known \\nhe would, but when Halder spoke up, it was a pleasant surprise. Grenn was anxious at the first, but Jon \\nknew the words to move him. One by one the rest fell in line. Jon persuaded some, cajoled some, \\nshamed the others, made threats where threats were required. At the end they had all agreed . . . all but \\nRast. \\n\"You girls do as you please,\" Rast said, \"but if Thorne sends me against Lady Piggy, I\\'m going to slice \\nme off a rasher of bacon.\" He laughed in Jon\\'s face and left them there. \\nHours later, as the castle slept, three of them paid a call on his cell. Grenn held his arms while Pyp sat on \\nhis legs. Jon could hear Rast\\'s rapid breathing as Ghost leapt onto his chest. The direwolf\\'s eyes burned \\nred as embers as his teeth nipped lightly at the soft skin of the boy\\'s throat, just enough to draw blood. \\n\"Remember, we know where you sleep,\" Jon said softly. \\nThe next morning Jon heard Rast tell Albett and Toad how his razor had slipped while he shaved. \\nFrom that day forth, neither Rast nor any of the others would hurt Samwell Tarly. When Ser Alliser \\nmatched them against him, they would stand their ground and swat aside his slow, clumsy strokes. If the \\nmaster-at-arms screamed for an attack, they would dance in and tap Sam lightly on breastplate or helm \\nor leg. Ser Alliser raged and threatened and called them all cravens and women and worse, yet Sam \\nremained unhurt. A few nights later, at Jon\\'s urging, he joined them for the evening meal, taking a place \\non the bench beside Halder. It was another fortnight before he found the nerve to join their talk, but in \\ntime he was laughing at Pyp\\'s faces and teasing Grenn with the best of them. \\nFat and awkward and frightened he might be, but Samwell Tarly was no fool. One night he visited Jon in \\n  180\\n\\nhis cell. \"I don\\'t know what you did,\" he said, \"but I know you did it.\" He looked away shyly. \"I\\'ve never \\nhad a friend before.\" \\n\"We\\'re not friends,\" Jon said. He put a hand on Sam\\'s broad shoulder. \"We\\'re brothers.\" \\nAnd so they were, he thought to himself after Sam had taken his leave. Robb and Bran and Rickon were \\nhis father\\'s sons, and he loved them still, yet Jon knew that he had never truly been one of them. Catelyn \\nStark had seen to that. The grey walls of Winterfell might still haunt his dreams, but Castle Black was his \\nlife now, and his brothers were Sam and Grenn and Halder and Pyp and the other cast-outs who wore \\nthe black of the Night\\'s Watch. \\n\"My uncle spoke truly,\" he whispered to Ghost. He wondered if he would ever see Benjen Stark again, \\nto tell him. \\nEDDARD \\n\"\\'It\\'s the Hand\\'s tourney that\\'s the cause of all the trouble, my lords,\" the Commander of the City Watch \\ncomplained to the king\\'s council. \\n\"The king\\'s tourney,\" Ned corrected, wincing. \"I assure you, the Hand wants no part of it.\" \\n\"Call it what you will, my lord. Knights have been arriving from all over the realm, and for every knight \\nwe get two freeriders, three craftsmen, six men-at-arms, a dozen merchants, two dozen whores, and \\nmore thieves than I dare guess. This cursed heat had half the city in a fever to start, and now with all \\nthese visitors . . . last night we had a drowning, a tavern riot, three knife fights, a rape, two fires, \\nrobberies beyond count, and a drunken horse race down the Street of the Sisters. The night before a \\nwoman\\'s head was found in the Great Sept, floating in the rainbow pool. No one seems to know how it \\ngot there or who it belongs to.\" \\n\"How dreadful,\" Varys said with a shudder. \\nLord Renly Baratheon was less sympathetic. \"If you cannot keep the king\\'s peace, Janos, perhaps the \\nCity Watch should be commanded by someone who can.\" \\nStout, jowly Janos Slynt puffed himself up like an angry frog, his bald pate reddening. \"Aegon the \\nDragon himself could not keep the peace, Lord Renly. I need more men.\" \\n\"How many?\" Ned asked, leaning forward. As ever, Robert had not troubled himself to attend the \\ncouncil session, so it fell to his Hand to speak for him. \\n\"As many as can be gotten, Lord Hand.\" \\n\"Hire fifty new men,\" Ned told him. \"Lord Baelish will see that you get the coin.\" \\n\"I will?\" Littlefinger said. \\n\"You will. You found forty thousand golden dragons for a champion\\'s purse, surely you can scrape \\n  181\\n\\ntogether a few coppers to keep the king\\'s peace.\" Ned turned back to Janos Slynt. \"I will also give you \\ntwenty good swords from my own household guard, to serve with the Watch until the crowds have left.\" \\n\"All thanks, Lord Hand,\" Slynt said, bowing. \"I promise you, they shall be put to good use.\" \\nWhen the Commander had taken his leave, Eddard Stark turned to the rest of the council. \"The sooner \\nthis folly is done with, the better I shall like it.\" As if the expense and trouble were not irksome enough, all \\nand sundry insisted on salting Ned\\'s wound by calling it \"the Hand\\'s tourney,\" as if he were the cause of \\nit. And Robert honestly seemed to think he should feel honored! \\n\"The realm prospers from such events, my lord,\" Grand Maester Pycelle said. \"They bring the great the \\nchance of glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.\" \\n\"And put coins in many a pocket,\" Littlefinger added. \"Every inn in the city is full, and the whores are \\nwalking bowlegged and jingling with each step.\" \\nLord Renly laughed. \"We\\'re fortunate my brother Stannis is not with us. Remember the time he \\nproposed to outlaw brothels? The king asked him if perhaps he\\'d like to outlaw eating, shitting, and \\nbreathing while he was at it. If truth be told, I ofttimes wonder how Stannis ever got that ugly daughter of \\nhis. He goes to his marriage bed like a man marching to a battlefield, with a grim look in his eyes and a \\ndetermination to do his duty.\" \\nNed had not joined the laughter. \"I wonder about your brother Stannis as well. I wonder when he \\nintends to end his visit to Dragonstone and resume his seat on this council.\" \\n\"No doubt as soon as we\\'ve scourged all those whores into the sea,\" Littlefinger replied, provoking more \\nlaughter. \\n\"I have heard quite enough about whores for one day,\" Ned said, rising. \"Until the morrow.\" \\nHarwin had the door when Ned returned to the Tower of the Hand. \\n\"Summon Jory to my chambers and tell your father to saddle my horse,\" Ned told him, too brusquely. \\n\"As you say, my lord.\" \\nThe Red Keep and the \"Hand\\'s tourney\" were chafing him raw, Ned reflected as he climbed. He \\nyearned for the comfort of Catelyn\\'s arms, for the sounds of Robb and Jon crossing swords in the \\npractice yard, for the cool days and cold nights of the north. \\nIn his chambers he stripped off his council silks and sat for a moment with the book while he waited for \\nJory to arrive. The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, With \\nDescliptions of Many High Lords and Noble Ladies and Their Children, by Grand Maester Malleon. \\nPycelle had spoken truly; it made for ponderous reading. Yet Jon Arryn had asked for it, and Ned felt \\ncertain he had reasons. There was something here, some truth buried in these brittle yellow pages, if only \\nhe could see it. But what? The tome was over a century old. Scarcely a man now alive had yet been born \\nwhen Malleon had compiled his dusty lists of weddings, births, and deaths. \\nHe opened to the section on House Lannister once more, and turned the pages slowly, hoping against \\n  182\\n\\nhope that something would leap out at him. The Lannisters were an old family, tracing their descent back \\nto Lann the Clever, a trickster from the Age of Heroes who was no doubt as legendary as Bran the \\nBuilder, though far more beloved of singers and taletellers. In the songs, Lann was the fellow who \\nwinkled the Casterlys out of Casterly Rock with no weapon but his wits, and stole gold from the sun to \\nbrighten his curly hair. Ned wished he were here now, to winkle the truth out of this damnable book. \\nA sharp rap on the door heralded Jory Cassel. Ned closed Malleon\\'s tome and bid him enter. \"I\\'ve \\npromised the City Watch twenty of my guard until the tourney is done,\" he told him. \"I rely on you to \\nmake the choice. Give Alyn the command, and make certain the men understand that they are needed to \\nstop fights, not start them.\" Rising, Ned opened a cedar chest and removed a light linen undertunic. \"Did \\nyou find the stableboy?\" \\n\"The watchman, my lord,\" Jory said. \"He vows he\\'ll never touch another horse.\" \\n\"What did he have to say?\" \\n\"He claims he knew Lord Arryn well. Fast friends, they were.\" Jory snorted. \"The Hand always gave the \\nlads a copper on their name days, he says. Had a way with horses. Never rode his mounts too hard, and \\nbrought them carrots and apples, so they were always pleased to see him.\" \\n\"Carrots and apples,\" Ned repeated. It sounded as if this boy would \\nbe even less use than the others. And he was the last of the four Littlefinger had turned up. Jory had \\nspoken to each of them in turn. Ser Hugh had been brusque and uninformative, and arrogant as only a \\nnew-made knight can be. If the Hand wished to talk to him, he should be pleased to receive him, but he \\nwould not be questioned by a mere captain of guards . . . even if said captain was ten years older and a \\nhundred times the swordsman. The serving girl had at least been pleasant. She said Lord Jon had been \\nreading more than was good for him, that he was troubled and melancholy over his young son\\'s frailty, \\nand gruff with his lady wife. The potboy, now cordwainer, had never exchanged so much as a word with \\nLord Jon, but he was full of oddments of kitchen gossip: the lord had been quarreling with the king, the \\nlord only picked at his food, the lord was sending his boy to be fostered on Dragonstone, the lord had \\ntaken a great interest in the breeding of hunting hounds, the lord had visited a master armorer to \\ncommission a new suit of plate, wrought all in pale silver with a blue jasper falcon and a mother-of-pearl \\nmoon on the breast. The king\\'s own brother had gone with him to help choose the design, the potboy \\nsaid. No, not Lord Renly, the other one, Lord Stannis. \\n\"Did our watchman recall anything else of note?\" \\n\"The lad swears Lord Jon was as strong as a man half his age. Often went riding with Lord Stannis, he \\nsays.\" \\nStannis again, Ned thought. He found that curious. Jon Arryn and he had been cordial, but never \\nfriendly. And while Robert had been riding north to Winterfell, Stannis had removed himself to \\nDragonstone, the Targaryen island fastness he had conquered in his brother\\'s name. He had given no \\nword as to when he might return. \"Where did they go on these rides?\" Ned asked. \\n\"The boy says that they visited a brothel.\" \\n\"A brothel?\" Ned said. \"The Lord of the Eyrie and Hand of the King visited a brothel with Stannis \\n  183\\n\\nBaratheon?\" He shook his head, incredulous, wondering what Lord Renly would make of this tidbit. \\nRobert\\'s lusts were the subject of ribald drinking songs throughout the realm, but Stannis was a different \\nsort of man; a bare year younger than the king, yet utterly unlike him, stern, humorless, unforgiving, grim \\nin his sense of duty. \\n\"The boy insists it\\'s true. The Hand took three guardsmen with him, and the boy says they were joking of \\nit when he took their horses afterward.\" \\n\"Which brothel?\" Ned asked. \\n\"The boy did not know. The guards would.\" \\n\"A pity Lysa carried them off to the Vale,\" Ned said dryly. \"The \\ngods are doing their best to vex us. Lady Lysa, Maester Colemon, Lord Stannis ... everyone who might \\nactually know the truth of what happened to Jon Arryn is a thousand leagues away.\" \\n\"Will you summon Lord Stannis back from Dragonstone?\" \\n\"Not yet,\" Ned said. \"Not until I have a better notion of what this is all about and where he stands.\" The \\nmatter nagged at him. Why did Stannis leave? Had he played some part in Jon Arryn\\'s murder? Or was \\nhe afraid? Ned found it hard to imagine what could frighten Stannis Baratheon, who had once held \\nStorm\\'s End through a year of siege, surviving on rats and boot leather while the Lords Tyrell and \\nRedwyne sat outside with their hosts, banqueting in sight of his walls. \\n\"Bring me my doublet, if you would. The grey, with the direwolf sigil. I want this armorer to know who I \\nam. It might make him more forthcoming.\" \\nJory went to the wardrobe. \"Lord Renly is brother to Lord Stannis as well as the king.\" \\n\"Yet it seems that he was not invited on these rides.\" Ned was not sure what to make of Renly, with all \\nhis friendly ways and easy smiles. A few days past, he had taken Ned aside to show him an exquisite \\nrose gold locklet. Inside was a miniature painted in the vivid Myrish style, of a lovely young girl with doe\\'s \\neyes and a cascade of soft brown hair. Renly had seemed anxious to know if the girl reminded him of \\nanyone, and when Ned had no answer but a shrug, he had seemed disappointed. The maid was Loras \\nTyrell\\'s sister Margaery, he\\'d confessed, but there were those who said she looked like Lyanna. \"No,\" \\nNed had told him, bemused. Could it be that Lord Renly, who looked so like a young Robert, had \\nconceived a passion for a girl he fancied to be a young Lyanna? That struck him as more than passing \\nqueer. \\nJory held out the doublet, and Ned slid his hands through the armholes. \"Perhaps Lord Stannis will \\nreturn for Robert\\'s tourney,\" he said as Jory laced the garment up the back. \\n\"That would be a stroke of fortune, my lord,\" Jory said. \\nNed buckled on a longsword. \"In other words, not bloody likely.\" His smile was grim. \\nJory draped Ned\\'s cloak across his shoulders and clasped it at the throat with the Hand\\'s badge of \\noffice. \"The armorer lives above his shop, in a large house at the top of the Street of Steel. Alyn knows \\n  184\\n\\nthe way, my lord.\" \\nNed nodded. \"The gods help this potboy if he\\'s sent me off haring after shadows.\" It was a slim enough \\nstaff to lean on, but the Jon Arryn that Ned Stark had known was not one to wear jeweled and silvered \\nplate. Steel was steel; it was meant for protection, not ornament. He \\nA GAML OF THRONLS 245 \\nmight have changed his views, to be sure. He would scarcely have been the first man who came to look \\non things differently after a few years at court . . . but the change was marked enough to make Ned \\nwonder. \\n\"Is there any other service I might perform?\" \\n\"I suppose you\\'d best begin visiting whorehouses.\" \\n\"Hard duty, my lord.\" Jory grinned. \"The men will be glad to help. Porther has made a fair start already.\" \\nNed\\'s favorite horse was saddled and waiting in the yard. Varly and Jacks fell in beside him as he rode \\nthrough the yard. Their steel caps and shirts of mail must have been sweltering, yet they said no word of \\ncomplaint. As Lord Eddard passed beneath the King\\'s Gate into the stink of the city, his grey and white \\ncloak streaming from his shoulders, he saw eyes everywhere and kicked his mount into a trot. His guard \\nfollowed. \\nHe looked behind him frequently as they made their way through the crowded city streets. Tomard and \\nDesmond had left the castle early this morning to take up positions on the route they must take, and \\nwatch for anyone following them, but even so, Ned was uncertain. The shadow of the King\\'s Spider and \\nhis little birds had him fretting like a maiden on her wedding night. \\nThe Street of Steel began at the market square beside the River Gate, as it was named on maps, or the \\nMud Gate, as it was commonly called. A mummer on stilts was striding through the throngs like some \\ngreat insect, with a horde of barefoot children trailing behind him, hooting. Elsewhere, two ragged boys \\nno older than Bran were dueling with sticks, to the loud encouragement of some and the furious curses of \\nothers. An old woman ended the contest by leaning out of her window and emptying a bucket of slops \\non the heads of the combatants. In the shadow of the wall, farmers stood beside their wagons, bellowing \\nout, \"Apples, the best apples, cheap at twice the price,\" and \"Blood melons, sweet as honey,\" and \\n\"Turnips, onions, roots, here you go here, here you go, turnips, onions, roots, here you go here.\" \\nThe Mud Gate was open, and a squad of City Watchmen stood under the portcullis in their golden \\ncloaks, leaning on spears. When a column of riders appeared from the west, the guardsmen sprang into \\naction, shouting commands and moving the carts and foot traffic aside to let the knight enter with his \\nescort. The first rider through the gate carried a long black banner. The silk rippled in the wind like a \\nliving thing; across the fabric was blazoned a night sky slashed with purple lightning. \"Make way for Lord \\nBeric!\" the rider shouted. \"Make wayfor Lord Befic!\" And close behind came the young lord himself, a \\ndashing \\nI \\nfigure on a black courser, with red-gold hair and a black satin cloak dusted with stars. \"Here to fight in \\n  185\\n\\nthe Hand\\'s tourney, my lord?\" a guardsman called out to him. \"Here to win the Hand\\'s tourney,\" Lord \\nBeric shouted back as the crowd cheered. \\nNed turned off the square where the Street of Steel began and \\nfollowed its winding path up a long hill, past blacksmiths working at open forges, freeriders haggling over \\nmail shirts, and grizzled ironmongers selling old blades and razors from their wagons. The farther they \\nclimbed, the larger the buildings grew. The man they wanted was all the way at the top of the hill, in a \\nhuge house of timber and plaster whose upper stories loomed over the narrow street. The double doors \\nshowed a hunting scene carved in ebony and weirwood. A pair of stone knights stood sentry at the \\nentrance, armored in fanciful suits of polished red steel that transformed them into griffin and unicorn. \\nNed left his horse with Jacks and shouldered his way inside. \\nThe slim young serving girl took quick note of Ned\\'s badge and the sigil on his doublet, and the master \\ncame hurrying out, all smiles and bows. \"Wine for the King\\'s Hand,\" he told the girl, gesturing Ned to a \\ncouch. \"I am Tobho Mott, my lord, please, please, put yourself at ease.\" He wore a black velvet coat \\nwith hammers embroidered on the sleeves in silver thread, Around his neck was a heavy silver chain and \\na sapphire as large as a pigeon\\'s egg. \"If you are in need of new arms for the Hand\\'s tourney, you have \\ncome to the right shop.\" Ned did not bother to correct him. \"My work is costly, and I make no apologies \\nfor \\nthat, my lord,\" he said as he filled two matching silver goblets. \"You will not find craftsmanship equal to \\nmine anywhere in the Seven Kingdoms, I promise you. Visit every forge in King\\'s Landing if you like, and \\ncompare for yourself. Any village smith can hammer out a shift of mail; my work is art.\" \\nNed sipped his wine and let the man go on. The Knight of Flowers bought all his armor here, Tobho \\nboasted, and many high lords, the ones who knew fine steel, and even Lord Renly, the king\\'s own \\nbrother. Perhaps the Hand had seen Lord Renly\\'s new armor, the green plate with the golden antlers? \\nNo other armorer in the city could \\nget that deep a green; he knew the secret of putting color in the steel itself, paint and enamel were the \\ncrutches of a journeyman. Or mayhaps the Hand wanted a blade? Tobho had learned to work Valyrian \\nsteel at the forges of Oohor as a boy. Only a man who knew \\nthe spells could take old weapons and forge them anew. \"The direwolf was the sigil of House Stark, is it \\nnot? I could fashion a direwolf helm so real that children will run from you in the street,\" he vowed. \\nNed smiled. \"Did you make a falcon helm for Lord Arryn?\" \\nTobho Mott paused a long moment and set aside his wine. \"The Hand did call upon me, with Lord \\nStannis, the king\\'s brother. I regret to say, they did not honor me with their patronage.\" \\nNed looked at the man evenly, saying nothing, waiting. He had found over the years that silence \\nsometimes yielded more than questions. And so it was this time. \\n\"They asked to see the boy,\" the armorer said, \"so I took them back to the forge.\" \\n\"The boy,\" Ned echoed. He had no notion who the boy might be. \"I should like to see the boy as well.\" \\n  186\\n\\nTobho Mott gave him a cool, careful look. \"As you wish, my lord,\" he said with no trace of his former \\nfriendliness. He led Ned out a rear door and across a narrow yard, back to the cavernous stone barn \\nwhere the work was done. When the armorer opened the door, the blast of hot air that came through \\nmade Ned feel as though he were walking into a dragon\\'s mouth. Inside, a forge blazed in each corner, \\nand the air stank of smoke and sulfur. Journeymen armorers glanced up from their hammers and tongs \\njust long enough to wipe the sweat from their brows, while bare-chested apprentice boys worked the \\nbellows. \\nThe master called over a tall lad about Robb\\'s age, his arms and chest corded with muscle. \"This is Lord \\nStark, the new Hand of the King,\" he told him as the boy looked at Ned through sullen blue eyes and \\npushed back sweat-soaked hair with his fingers. Thick hair, shaggy and unkempt and black as ink. The \\nshadow of a new beard darkened his jaw. \"This is Gendry. Strong for his age, and he works hard. Show \\nthe Hand that helmet you made, lad.\" Almost shyly, the boy led them to his bench, and a steel helm \\nshaped like a bull\\'s head, with two great curving horns. \\nNed turned the helm over in his hands. It was raw steel, unpolished but expertly shaped. \"This is fine \\nwork. I would be pleased if you would let me buy it.\" \\nThe boy snatched it out of his hands. \"It\\'s not for sale.\" \\nTobho Mott looked horror-struck. \"Boy, this is the King\\'s Hand. If his lordship wants this helm, make \\nhim a gift of it. He honors you by asking.\" \\n\"I made it for me,\" the boy said stubbornly. \\n\"A hundred pardons, my lord,\" his master said hurriedly to Ned. \"The boy is crude as new steel, and like \\nnew steel would profit from some beating. That helm is journeyman\\'s work at best. Forgive him and I \\npromise I will craft you a helm like none you have ever seen.\" \\n\"He\\'s done nothing that requires my forgiveness. Gendry, when Lord Arryn came to see you, what did \\nyou talk about?\" \\n\"He asked me questions is all, m\\'lord.\" \\n\"What sort of questions?\" \\nThe boy shrugged. \"How was 1, and was I well treated, and if I liked the work, and stuff about my \\nmother. Who she was and what she looked like and all.\" \\n\"What did you tell him?\" Ned asked. \\nThe boy shoved a fresh fall of black hair off his forehead. \"She died when I was little. She had yellow \\nhair, and sometimes she used to sing to me, I remember. She worked in an alehouse.\" \\n\"Did Lord Stannis question you as well?\" \\n\"The bald one? No, not him. He never said no word, just glared at me, like I was some raper who done \\nfor his daughter.\" \\n  187\\n\\n\"Mind your filthy tongue,\" the master said. \"This is the King\\'s own Hand.\" The boy lowered his eyes. \"A \\nsmart boy, but stubborn. That helm . . . the others call him bullheaded, so he threw it in their teeth.\" \\nNed touched the boy\\'s head, fingering the thick black hair. \"Look at me, Gendry.\" The apprentice lifted \\nhis face. Ned studied the shape of his jaw, the eyes like blue ice. Yes, he thought, I see it. \"Go back to \\nyour work, lad. I\\'m sorry to have bothered you.\" He walked back to the house with the master. \"Who \\npaid the boy\\'s apprentice fee?\" he asked lightly. \\nMott looked fretful. \"You saw the boy. Such a strong boy. Those hands of his, those hands were made \\nfor hammers. He had such promise, I took him on without a fee.\" \\n\"The truth now,\" Ned urged. \"The streets are full of strong boys. The day you take on an apprentice \\nwithout a fee will be the day the Wall comes down. Who paid for him?\" \\n\"A lord,\" the master said reluctantly. \"He gave no name, and wore no sigil on his coat. He paid in gold, \\ntwice the customary sum, and said he was paying once for the boy, and once for my silence.\" \\n\"Describe him.\" \\n\"He was stout, round of shoulder, not so tall as you. Brown beard, but there was a bit of red in it, I\\'ll \\nswear. He wore a rich cloak, that I do remember, heavy purple velvet worked with silver threads, but the \\nhood shadowed his face and I never did see him clear.\" He hesitated a moment. \"My lord, I want no \\ntrouble.\" \\n\"None of us wants trouble, but I fear these are troubled times, Master Mott,\" Ned said. \"You know who \\nthe boy is.\" \\n\"I am only an armorer, my lord. I know what I\\'m told.\" \\n\"You know who the boy is,\" Ned repeated patiently. \"That is not a question.\" \\n\"The boy is my apprentice,\" the master said. He looked Ned in the eye, stubborn as old iron. \"Who he \\nwas before he came to me, that\\'s none of my concern.\" \\nNed nodded. He decided that he liked Tobho Mott, master armorer. \"If the day ever comes when \\nGendry would rather wield a sword than forge one, send him to me. He has the look of a warrior. Until \\nthen, you have my thanks, Master Mott, and my promise. Should I ever want a helm to frighten children, \\nthis will be the first place I visit.\" \\nHis guard was waiting outside with the horses. \"Did you find anything, my lord?\" Jacks asked as Ned \\nmounted up. \\n\"I did,\" Ned told him, wondering. What had Jon Arryn wanted with a king\\'s bastard, and why was it \\nworth his life? \\nCATELYN \\n  188\\n\\nMy lady, you ought cover your head,\" Ser Rodrik told her as their horses plodded north. \"You will take \\na chill.\" \\n\"It is only water, Ser Rodrik,\" Catelyn replied. Her hair hung wet and heavy, a loose strand stuck to her \\nforehead, and she could imagine how ragged and wild she must look, but for once she did not care. The \\nsouthern rain was soft and warm. Catelyn liked the feel of it on her face, gentle as a mother\\'s kisses. It \\ntook her back to her childhood, to long grey days at Riverrun. She remembered the godswood, drooping \\nbranches heavy with moisture, and the sound of her brother\\'s laughter as he chased her through piles of \\ndamp leaves. She remembered making mud pies with Lysa, the weight of them, the mud slick and brown \\nbetween her fingers. They had served them to Littlefinger, giggling, and he\\'d eaten so much mud he was \\nsick for a week. How young they all had been. \\nCatelyn had almost forgotten. In the north, the rain fell cold and hard, and sometimes at night it turned to \\nice. It was as likely to kill a crop as nurture it, and it sent grown men running for the nearest shelter. That \\nwas no rain for little girls to play in. \\n\"I am soaked through,\" Ser Rodrik complained. \"Even my bones are wet.\" The woods pressed close \\naround them, and the steady pattering of rain on leaves was accompanied by the small sucking sounds \\ntheir horses made as their hooves pulled free of the mud. \"We will want a fire tonight, my lady, and a hot \\nmeal would serve us both.\" \\n\"There is an inn at the crossroads up ahead,\" Catelyn told him. She had slept many a night there in her \\nyouth, traveling with her father. Lord Hoster Tully had been a restless man in his prime, always riding \\nsomewhere. She still remembered the innkeep, a fat woman named Masha Heddle who chewed sourleaf \\nnight and day and seemed to have an endless supply of smiles and sweet cakes for the children. The \\nsweet cakes had been soaked with honey, rich and heavy on the tongue, but how Catelyn had dreaded \\nthose smiles. The sourleaf had stained Masha\\'s teeth a dark red, and made her smile a bloody horror. \\n\"An inn,\" Ser Rodrik repeated wistfully. \"If only . . . but we dare not risk it. If we wish to remain \\nunknown, I think it best we seek out some small holdfast . . .\" He broke off as they heard sounds up the \\nroad; splashing water, the clink of mail, a horse\\'s whinny. \"Riders,\" he warned, his hand dropping to the \\nhilt of his sword. Even on the kingsroad, it never hurt to be wary. \\nThey followed the sounds around a lazy bend of the road and saw them; a column of armed men noisily \\nfording a swollen stream. Catelyn reined up to let them pass. The banner in the hand of the foremost rider \\nhung sodden and limp, but the guardsmen wore indigo cloaks and on their shoulders flew the silver eagle \\nof Seagard. \"Mallisters,\" Ser Rodrik whispered to her, as if she had not known. \"My lady, best pull up \\nyour hood.\" \\nCatelyn made no move. Lord Jason Mallister himself rode with them, surrounded by his knights, his son \\nPatrek by his side and their squires close behind. They were riding for King\\'s Landing and the Hand\\'s \\ntourney, she knew. For the past week, the travelers had been thick as flies upon the kingsroad; knights \\nand freeriders, singers with their harps and drums, heavy wagons laden with hops or corn or casks of \\nhoney, traders and craftsmen and whores, and all of them moving south. \\nShe studied Lord Jason boldly. The last time she had seen him he had been jesting with her uncle at her \\nwedding feast; the Mallisters stood bannermen to the Tullys, and his gifts had been lavish. His brown hair \\n  189\\n\\nwas salted with white now, his face chiseled gaunt by time, yet the years had not touched his pride. He \\nrode like a man who feared nothing. Catelyn envied him that; she had come to fear so much. As the \\nriders passed, Lord Jason nodded a curt greeting, but it was only a high lord\\'s courtesy to strangers \\nchance met on the road. There was no recognition in those fierce eyes, and his son did not even waste a \\nlook. \\n\"He did not know you,\" Ser Rodrik said after, wondering. \\n\"He saw a pair of mud-spattered travelers by the side of the road, wet and tired. It would never occur to \\nhim to suspect that one of them was the daughter of his liege lord. I think we shall be safe enough at the \\ninn, Ser Rodrik.\" \\nIt was near dark when they reached it, at the crossroads north of the great confluence of the Trident. \\nMasha Heddle was fatter and greyer than Catelyn remembered, still chewing her sourleaf, but she gave \\nthem only the most cursory of looks, with nary a hint of her ghastly red smile. \"Two rooms at the top of \\nthe stair, that\\'s all there is,\" she said, chewing all the while. \"They\\'re under the bell tower, you won\\'t be \\nmissing meals, though there\\'s some thinks it too noisy. Can\\'t be helped. We\\'re full up, or near as makes \\nno matter. It\\'s those rooms or the road.\" \\nIt was those rooms, low, dusty garrets at the top of a cramped narrow staircase. \"Leave your boots \\ndown here,\" Masha told them after she\\'d taken their coin. \"The boy will clean them. I won\\'t have you \\ntracking mud up my stairs. Mind the bell. Those who come late to meals don\\'t eat.\" There were no \\nsmiles, and no mention of sweet cakes. \\nWhen the supper bell rang, the sound was deafening. Catelyn had changed into dry clothes. She sat by \\nthe window, watching rain run down the pane. The glass was milky and full of bubbles, and a wet dusk \\nwas falling outside. Catelyn could just make out the muddy crossing where the two great roads met. \\nThe crossroads gave her pause. If they turned west from here, it was an easy ride down to Riverrun. \\nHer father had always given her wise counsel when she needed it most, and she yearned to talk to him, to \\nwarn him of the gathering storm. If Winterfell needed to brace for war, how much more so Riverrun, so \\nmuch closer to King\\'s Landing, with the power of Casterly Rock looming to the west like a shadow. If \\nonly her father had been stronger, she might have chanced it, but Hoster Tully had been bedridden these \\npast two years, and Catelyn was loath to tax him now. \\nThe eastern road was wilder and more dangerous, climbing through rocky foothills and thick forests into \\nthe Mountains of the Moon, past high passes and deep chasms to the Vale of Arryn and the stony \\nFingers beyond. Above the Vale, the Eyrie stood high and impregnable, its towers reaching for the sky. \\nThere she would find her sister . . . and, perhaps, some of the answers Ned sought. Surely Lysa knew \\nmore than she had dared to put in her letter. She might have the very proof that Ned needed to bring the \\nLannisters to ruin, and if it came to \\nwar, they would need the Arryns and the eastern lords who owed them service. \\nYet the mountain road was perilous. Shadowcats prowled those passes, rock slides were common, and \\nthe mountain clans were lawless brigands, descending from the heights to rob and kill and melting away \\nlike snow whenever the knights rode out from the Vale in search of them. Even Jon Arryn, as great a lord \\n  190\\n\\nas any the Eyrie had ever known, had always traveled in strength when he crossed the mountains. \\nCatelyn\\'s only strength was one elderly knight, armored in loyalty. \\nNo, she thought, Riverrun and the Eyrie would have to wait. Her path ran north to Winterfell, where her \\nsons and her duty were waiting for her. As soon as they were safely past the Neck, she could declare \\nherself to one of Ned\\'s bannermen, and send riders racing ahead with orders to mount a watch on the \\nkingsroad. \\nThe rain obscured the fields beyond the crossroads, but Catelyn saw the land clear enough in her \\nmemory. The marketplace was just across the way, and the village a mile farther on, half a hundred white \\ncottages surrounding a small stone sept. There would be more now; the summer had been long and \\npeaceful. North of here the kingsroad ran along the Green Fork of the Trident, through fertile valleys and \\ngreen woodlands, past thriving towns and stout holdfasts and the castles of the river lords. \\nCatelyn knew them all: the Blackwoods and the Brackens, ever enemies, whose quarrels her father was \\nobliged to settle; Lady Whent, last of her line, who dwelt with her ghosts in the cavernous vaults of \\nHarrenhal; irascible Lord Frey, who had outlived seven wives and filled his twin castles with children, \\ngrandchildren, and great-grandchildren, and bastards and grandbastards as well. All of them were \\nbannermen to the Tullys, their swords sworn to the service of Riverrun. Catelyn wondered if that would \\nbe enough, if it came to war. Her father was the staunchest man who\\'d ever lived, and she had no doubt \\nthat he would call his banners . . . but would the banners come? The Darrys and Rygers and Mootons \\nhad sworn oaths to Riverrun as well, yet they had fought with Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident, while \\nLord Frey had arrived with his levies well after the battle was over, leaving some doubt as to which army \\nhe had planned to join (theirs, he had assured the victors solemnly in the aftermath, but ever after her \\nfather had called him the Late Lord Frey). It must not come to war, Catelyn thought fervently. They must \\nnot let it. \\nSer Rodrik came for her just as the bell ceased its clangor. \"We had best make haste if we hope to eat \\ntonight, my lady.\" \\n\"It might be safer if we were not knight and lady until we pass the \\nNeck,\" she told him. \"Common travelers attract less notice. A father and daughter taken to the road on \\nsome family business, say.\" \\n\"As you say, my lady,\" Ser Rodrik agreed. It was only when she laughed that he realized what he\\'d \\ndone. \"The old courtesies die hard, my-my daughter.\" He tried to tug on his missing whiskers, and sighed \\nwith exasperation. \\nCatelyn took his arm. \"Come, Father,\" she said. \"You\\'ll find that Masha Heddle sets a good table, I \\nthink, but try not to praise her. You truly don\\'t want to see her smile.\" \\nThe common room was long and drafty, with a row of huge wooden kegs at one end and a fireplace at \\nthe other. A serving boy ran back and forth with skewers of meat while Masha drew beer from the kegs, \\nchewing her sourleaf all the while. \\nThe benches were crowded, townsfolk and farmers mingling freely with all manner of travelers. The \\ncrossroads made for odd companions; dyers with black and purple hands shared a bench with rivermen \\nreeking of fish, an ironsmith thick with muscle squeezed in beside a wizened old septon, hard-bitten \\n  191\\n\\nsellswords and soft plump merchants swapped news like boon companions. \\nThe company included more swords than Catelyn would have liked. Three by the fire wore the red \\nstallion badge of the Brackens, and there was a large party in blue steel ringmail and capes of a silvery \\ngrey. On their shoulder was another familiar sigil, the twin towers of House Frey. She studied their faces, \\nbut they were all too young to have known her. The senior among them would have been no older than \\nBran when she went north. \\nSer Rodrik found them an empty place on the bench near the kitchen. Across the table a handsome \\nyouth was fingering a woodharp. \"Seven blessings to you, goodfolk,\" he said as they sat. An empty wine \\ncup stood on the table before him. \\n\"And to you, singer,\" Catelyn returned. Ser Rodrik called for bread and meat and beer in a tone that \\nmeant now. The singer, a youth of some eighteen years, eyed them boldly and asked where they were \\ngoing, and from whence they had come, and what news they had, letting the questions fly as quick as \\narrows and never pausing for an answer. \"We left King\\'s Landing a fortnight ago,\" Catelyn replied, \\nanswering the safest of his questions. \\n\"That\\'s where I\\'m bound,\" the youth said. As she had suspected, he was more interested in telling his \\nown story than in hearing theirs. Singers loved nothing half so well as the sound of their own voices. \"The \\nHand\\'s tourney means rich lords with fat purses. The last time I \\ncame away with more silver than I could carry ... or would have, if I hadn\\'t lost it all betting on the \\nKingslayer to win the day.\" \\n\"The gods frown on the gambler,\" Ser Rodrik said sternly. He was of the north, and shared the Stark \\nviews on tournaments. \\n\"They frowned on me, for certain,\" the singer said. \"Your cruel gods and the Knight of Flowers \\naltogether did me in.\" \\n\"No doubt that was a lesson for you,\" Ser Rodrik said. \\n\"It was. This time my coin will champion Ser Loras.\" \\nSer Rodrik tried to tug at whiskers that were not there, but before he could frame a rebuke the serving \\nboy came scurrying up. He laid trenchers of bread before them and filled them with chunks of browned \\nmeat off a skewer, dripping with hot juice. Another skewer held tiny onions, fire peppers, and fat \\nmushrooms. Ser Rodrik set to lustily as the lad ran back to fetch them beer. \\n\"My name is Marillion,\" the singer said, plucking a string on his woodharp. \"Doubtless you\\'ve heard me \\nplay somewhere?\" \\nHis manner made Catelyn smile. Few wandering singers ever ventured as far north as Winterfell, but she \\nknew his like from her girlhood in Riverrun. \"I fear not,\" she told him. \\nHe drew a plaintive chord from the woodharp. \"That is your loss,\" he said. \"Who was the finest singer \\nyou\\'ve ever heard?\" \\n  192\\n\\n\"Alia of Braavos,\" Ser Rodrik answered at once. \\n\"Oh, I\\'m much better than that old stick,\" Marillion said. \"If you have the silver for a song, I\\'ll gladly \\nshow you.\" \\n\"I might have a copper or two, but I\\'d sooner toss it down a well than pay for your howling,\" Ser Rodrik \\ngroused. His opinion of singers was well known; music was a lovely thing for girls, but he could not \\ncomprehend why any healthy boy would fill his hand with a harp when he might have had a sword. \\n\"Your grandfather has a sour nature,\" Marillion said to Catelyn. \"I meant to do you honor. An homage to \\nyour beauty. In truth, I was made to sing for kings and high lords.\" \\n\"Oh, I can see that,\" Catelyn said. \"Lord Tully is fond of song, I hear. No doubt you\\'ve been to \\nRiverrun.\" \\n\"A hundred times,\" the singer said airily. \"They keep a chamber for me, and the young lord is like a \\nbrother.\" \\nCatelyn smiled, wondering what Edmure would think of that. Another singer had once bedded a girl her \\nbrother fancied; he had hated the breed ever since. \"And Winterfell?\" she asked him. \"Have you traveled \\nnorth?\" \\n\"Why would IT\\' Marillion asked. \"It\\'s all blizzards and bearskins up there, and the Starks know no music \\nbut the howling of wolves.\" \\nDistantly, she was aware of the door banging open at the far end of the room. \\n\"Innkeep,\" a servant\\'s voice called out behind her, \"we have horses that want stabling, and my lord of \\nLannister requires a room and a hot bath.\" \\n\"Oh, gods,\" Ser Rodrik said before Catelyn reached out to silence him, her fingers tightening hard \\naround his forearm. \\nMasha Heddle was bowing and smiling her hideous red smile. \"I\\'m sorry, m\\'lord, truly, we\\'re full up, \\nevery room.\" \\nThere were four of them, Catelyn saw. An old man in the black of the Night\\'s Watch, two servants . . . \\nand him, standing there small and bold as life. \"My men will steep in your stable, and as for myself, well, I \\ndo not require a large room, as you can plainly see.\" He flashed a mocking grin. \"So long as the fire\\'s \\nwarm and the straw reasonably free of fleas, I am a happy man.\" \\nMasha Heddle was beside herself. \"M\\'lord, there\\'s nothing, it\\'s the tourney, there\\'s no help for it, oh . . .\" \\nTyrion Lannister pulled a coin from his purse and flicked it up over his head, caught it, tossed it again. \\nEven across the room, where Catelyn sat, the wink of gold was unmistakable. \\nA freerider in a faded blue cloak lurched to his feet. \"You\\'re welcome to my room, m\\'lord.\" \\n\"Now there\\'s a clever man,\" Lannister said as he sent the coin spinning across the room. The freerider \\n  193\\n\\nsnatched it from the air. \"And a nimble one to boot.\" The dwarf turned back to Masha Heddle. \"You will \\nbe able to manage food, I trust?\" \\n\"Anything you like, m1ord, anything at all,\" the innkeep promised. And may he choke on it, Catelyn \\nthought, but it was Bran she saw choking, drowning on his own blood. \\nLannister glanced at the nearest tables. \"My men will have whatever you\\'re serving these people. Double \\nportions, we\\'ve had a long hard ride. I\\'ll take a roast fowl-chicken, duck, pigeon, it makes no matter. \\nAnd send up a flagon of your best wine. Yoren, will you sup with me?\" \\n\"Aye, m1ord, I will,\" the black brother replied. \\nThe dwarf had not so much as glanced toward the far end of the room, and Catelyn was thinking how \\ngrateful she was for the crowded benches between them when suddenly Marillion bounded to his feet. \\n\"My lord of Lannister!\" he called out. \"I would be pleased to entertain you while you eat. Let me sing you \\nthe lay of your father\\'s great victory at King\\'s Landing!\" \\n\"Nothing would be more likely to ruin my supper,\" the dwarf said \\ndryly. His mismatched eyes considered the singer briefly, started to move away . . . and found Catelyn. \\nHe looked at her for a moment, puzzled. She turned her face away, but too late. The dwarf was smiling. \\n\"Lady Stark, what an unexpected pleasure,\" he said. \"I was sorry to miss you at Winterfell.\" \\nMarillion gaped at her, confusion giving way to chagrin as Catelyn rose slowly to her feet. She heaTd \\nSeT Rodrik curse. If only the man had lingered at the Wall, she thought, if only . . . \\n\"Lady . . . Stark?\" Masha Heddle said thickly. \\n\"I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I bedded here,\" she told the innkeep. She could hear the muttering, \\nfeel the eyes upon her. Catelyn glanced around the room, at the faces of the knights and sworn swords, \\nand took a deep breath to slow the frantic beating of her heart. Did she dare take the risk? There was no \\ntime to think it through, only the moment and the sound of her own voice ringing in her ears. \"You in the \\ncorner,\" she said to an older man she had not noticed until now. \"Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see \\nembroidered on your surcoat, ser?\" \\nThe man got to his feet. \"It is, my lady.\" \\n\"And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father, Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?\" \\n\"She is,\" the man replied stoutly. \\nSer Rodrik rose quietly and loosened his sword in its scabbard. The dwarf was blinking at them, \\nblank-faced, with puzzlement in his mismatched eyes. \\n\"The red stallion was ever a welcome sight in Riverrun,\" she said to the trio by the fire. \"My father counts \\nJonos Bracken among his oldest and most loyal bannermen.\" \\nThe three men-at-arms exchanged uncertain looks. \"Our lord is honored by his trust,\" one of them said \\nhesitantly. \\n  194\\n\\n\"I envy your father all these fine friends,\" Lannister quipped, \"but I do not quite see the purpose of this, \\nLady Stark.\" \\nShe ignored him, turning to the large party in blue and grey. They were the heart of the matter; there \\nwere more than twenty of them. \"I know your sigil as well: the twin towers of Frey. How fares your good \\nlord, sers?\" \\nTheir captain rose. \"Lord Walder is well, my lady. He plans to take a new wife on his ninetieth name \\nday, and has asked your lord father to honor the wedding with his presence.\" \\nTyrion Lannister sniggered. That was when Catelyn knew he was hers. \"This man came a guest into my \\nhouse, and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of seven,\" she proclaimed to the room at large, \\nI \\npointing. Ser Rodrik moved to her side, his sword in hand. \"In the name of King Robert and the good \\nlords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king\\'s \\njustice.\" \\nShe did not know what was more satisfying: the sound of a dozen swords drawn as one or the look on \\nTyrion Lannister\\'s face. \\nSANSA \\nSansa rode to the Hand\\'s tourney with Septa Mordane and Jeyne Poole, in a litter with curtains of \\nyellow silk so fine she could see right through them. They turned the whole world gold. Beyond the city \\nwalls, a hundred pavilions had been raised beside the river, and the common folk came out in the \\nthousands to watch the games. The splendor of it all took Sansa\\'s breath away; the shining armor, the \\ngreat chargers caparisoned in silver and gold, the shouts of the crowd, the banners snapping in the wind . \\n. . and the knights themselves, the knights most of all. \\n\"It is better than the songs,\" she whispered when they found the places that her father had promised her, \\namong the high lords and ladies. Sansa was dressed beautifully that day, in a green gown that brought out \\nthe auburn of her hair, and she knew they were looking at her and smiling. \\nThey watched the heroes of a hundred songs ride forth, each more fabulous than the last. The seven \\nknights of the Kingsguard took the field, all but Jaime Lannister in scaled armor the color of milk, their \\ncloaks as white as freshfallen snow. Ser Jaime wore the white cloak as well, but beneath it he was shining \\ngold from head to foot, with a lion\\'shead helm and a golden sword. Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain \\nThat Rides, thundered past them like an avalanche. Sansa remembered Lord Yohn Royce, who had \\nguested at Winterfell two years \\n260 GLORGL R.R. MARTIN \\nbefore. \"His armor is bronze, thousands and thousands of years old, engraved with magic runes that \\nward him against harm,\" she whispered to Jeyne. Septa Mordane pointed out Lord Jason Mallister, in \\n  195\\n\\nindigo chased with silver, the wings of an eagle on his helm. He had cut down three of Rhaegar\\'s \\nbannermen on the Trident. The girls giggled over the warrior priest Thoros of Myr, with his flapping red \\nrobes and shaven head, until the septa told them that he had once scaled the walls of Pyke with a flaming \\nsword in hand. \\nOther riders Sansa did not know; hedge knights from the Fingers and Highgarden and the mountains of \\nDorne, unsung freeriders and new-made squires, the younger sons of high lords and the heirs of lesser \\nhouses. Younger men, most had done no great deeds as yet, but Sansa and Jeyne agreed that one day \\nthe Seven Kingdoms would resound to the sound of their names. Ser Balon Swann. Lord Bryce Caron \\nof the Marches. Bronze Yohn\\'s heir, Ser Andar Royce, and his younger brother Ser Robar, their silvered \\nsteel plate filigreed in bronze with the same ancient runes that warded their father. The twins Ser Horas \\nand Ser Hobber, whose shields displayed the grape cluster sigil of the Redwynes, burgundy on blue. \\nPatrek Mallister, Lord Jason\\'s son. Six Freys of the Crossing: Ser Jared, Ser Hosteen, Ser Danwell, Ser \\nEmmon, Ser Theo, Ser Perwyn, sons and grandsons of old Lord Walder Frey, and his bastard son \\nMartyn Rivers as well. \\nJeyne Poole confessed herself frightened by the look of Jalabhar Xho, an exile prince from the Summer \\nIsles who wore a cape of green and scarlet feathers over skin as dark as night, but when she saw young \\nLord Beric Dondarrion, with his hair like red gold and his black shield slashed by lightning, she \\npronounced herself willing to marry him on the instant. \\nThe Hound entered the lists as well, and so too the king\\'s brother, handsome Lord Renly of Storm\\'s \\nEnd. Jory, Alyn, and Harwin rode for Winterfell and the north. \"Jory looks a beggar among these others,\" \\nSepta Mordane sniffed when he appeared. Sansa could only agree. Jory\\'s armor was blue-grey plate \\nwithout device or ornament, and a thin grey cloak hung from his shoulders like a soiled rag. Yet he \\nacquitted himself well, unhorsing Horas Redwyne in his first joust and one of the Freys in his second. In \\nhis third match, he rode three passes at a freerider named Lothor Brune whose armor was as drab as his \\nown. Neither man lost his seat, but Brune\\'s lance was steadier and his blows better placed, and the king \\ngave him the victory. Alyn and Harwin fared less well; Harwin was unhorsed in his first tilt by Ser Meryn \\nof the Kingsguard, while Alyn fell to Ser Balon Swann. \\nThe jousting went all day and into the dusk, the hooves of the great \\nwarhorses pounding down the lists until the field was a ragged wasteland of torn earth. A dozen times \\nJeyne and Sansa cried out in unison as riders crashed together, lances exploding into splinters while the \\ncommons screamed for their favorites. Jeyne covered her eyes whenever a man fell, like a frightened little \\ngirl, but Sansa was made of sterner stuff. A great lady knew how to behave at tournaments. Even Septa \\nMordane noted her composure and nodded in approval. \\nThe Kingslayer rode brilliantly. He overthrew Ser Andar Royce and the Marcher Lord Bryce Caron as \\neasily as if he were riding at rings, and then took a hard-fought match from white-haired Barristan Selmy, \\nwho had won his first two tilts against men thirty and forty years his junior. \\nSandor Clegane and his immense brother, Ser Gregor the Mountain, seemed unstoppable as well, riding \\ndown one foe after the next in ferocious style. The most terrifying moment of the day came during Ser \\nGregor\\'s second joust, when his lance rode up and struck a young knight from the Vale under the gorget \\nwith such force that it drove through his throat, killing him instantly. The youth fell not ten feet from where \\nSansa was seated. The point of Ser Gregor\\'s lance had snapped off in his neck, and his life\\'s blood \\nflowed out in slow pulses, each weaker than the one before. His armor was shiny new; a bright streak of \\n  196\\n\\nfire ran down his outstretched arm, as the steel caught the light. Then the sun went behind a cloud, and it \\nwas gone. His cloak was blue, the color of the sky on a clear summer\\'s day, trimmed with a border of \\ncrescent moons, but as his blood seeped into it, the cloth darkened and the moons turned red, one by \\none. \\nJeyne Poole wept so hysterically that Septa Mordane finally took her off to regain her composure, but \\nSansa sat with her hands folded in her lap, watching with a strange fascination. She had never seen a man \\ndie before. She ought to be crying too, she thought, but the tears would not come. Perhaps she had used \\nup all her tears for Lady and Bran. It would be different if it had been Jory or Ser Rodrik or Father, she \\ntold herself. The young knight in the blue cloak was nothing to her, some stranger from the Vale of Arryn \\nwhose name she had forgotten as soon as she heard it. And now the world would forget his name too, \\nSansa realized; there would be no songs sung for him. That was sad. \\nAfter they carried off the body, a boy with a spade ran onto the field and shoveled dirt over the spot \\nwhere he had fallen, to cover up the blood. Then the jousts resumed. \\nSer Balon Swann also fell to Gregor, and Lord Renly to the Hound. Renly was unhorsed so violently \\nthat he seemed to fly backward off his charger, legs in the air. His head hit the ground with an audible \\ncrack \\nthat made the crowd gasp, but it was just the golden antler on his helm. One of the tines had snapped off \\nbeneath him. When Lord Renly climbed to his feet, the commons cheered wildly, for King Robert\\'s \\nhandsome young brother was a great favorite. He handed the broken tine to his conqueror with a \\ngracious bow. The Hound snorted and tossed the broken antler into the crowd, where the commons \\nbegan to punch and claw over the little bit of gold, until Lord Renly walked out among them and restored \\nthe peace. By then Septa Mordane had returned, alone. Jeyne had been feeling ill, she explained; she had \\nhelped her back to the castle. Sansa had almost forgotten about Jeyne. \\nLater a hedge knight in a checkered cloak disgraced himself by killing Beric Dondarrion\\'s horse, and \\nwas declared forfeit. Lord Beric shifted his saddle to a new mount, only to be knocked right off it by \\nThoros of Myr. Ser Aron Santagar and Lothor Brune tilted thrice without result; Ser Aron fell afterward \\nto Lord Jason Mallister, and Brune to Yohn Royce\\'s younger son, Robar. \\nIn the end it came down to four; the Hound and his monstrous brother Gregor, Jaime Lannister the \\nKingslayer, and Ser Loras Tyrell, the youth they called the Knight of Flowers. \\nSer Loras was the youngest son of Mace Tyrell, the Lord of Highgarden and Warden of the South. At \\nsixteen, he was the youngest rider on the field, yet he had unhorsed three knights of the Kingsguard that \\nmorning in his first three jousts. Sansa had never seen anyone so beautiful. His plate was intricately \\nfashioned and enameled as a bouquet of a thousand different flowers, and his snow-white stallion was \\ndraped in a blanket of red and white roses. After each victory, Ser Loras would remove his helm and \\nride slowly round the fence, and finally pluck a single white rose from the blanket and toss it to some fair \\nmaiden in the crowd. \\nHis last match of the day was against the younger Royce. Ser Robar\\'s ancestral runes proved small \\nprotection as Ser Loras split his shield and drove him from his saddle to crash with an awful clangor in \\nthe dirt. Robar lay moaning as the victor made his circuit of the field. Finally they called for a litter and \\ncarried him off to his tent, dazed and unmoving. Sansa never saw it. Her eyes were only for Ser Loras. \\nWhen the white horse stopped in front of her, she thought her heart would burst. \\n  197\\n\\nTo the other maidens he had given white roses, but the one he plucked for her was red. \"Sweet lady,\" he \\nsaid, \"no victory is half so beautiful as you.\" Sansa took the flower timidly, struck dumb by his gallantry. \\nHis hair was a mass of lazy brown curls, his eyes like liquid \\ngold. She inhaled the sweet fragrance of the rose and sat clutching it long after Ser Loras had ridden off. \\nWhen Sansa finally looked up, a man was standing over her, staring. He was short, with a pointed beard \\nand a silver streak in his hair, almost as old as her father. \"You must be one of her daughters,\" he said to \\nher. He had grey-green eyes that did not smile when his mouth did. \"You have the Tully look.\" \\n\"I\\'m Sansa Stark,\" she said, ill at ease. The man wore a heavy cloak with a fur collar, fastened with a \\nsilver mockingbird, and he had the effortless manner of a high lord, but she did not know him. \"I have not \\nhad the honor, my lord.\" \\nSepta Mordane quickly took a hand. \"Sweet child, this is Lord Petyr Baelish, of the king\\'s small \\ncouncil.\" \\n\"Your mother was my queen of beauty once,\" the man said quietly. His breath smelled of mint. \"You \\nhave her hair.\" His fingers brushed against her cheek as he stroked one auburn lock. Quite abruptly he \\nturned and walked away. \\nBy then, the moon was well up and the crowd was tired, so the king decreed that the last three matches \\nwould be fought the next morning, before the melee. While the commons began their walk home, talking \\nof the day\\'s jousts and the matches to come on the morrow, the court moved to the riverside to begin the \\nfeast. Six monstrous huge aurochs had been roasting for hours, turning slowly on wooden spits while \\nkitchen boys basted them with butter and herbs until the meat crackled and spit. Tables and benches had \\nbeen raised outside the pavilions, piled high with sweetgrass and strawberries and fresh-baked bread. \\nSansa and Septa Mordane were given places of high honor, to the left of the raised dais where the king \\nhimself sat beside his queen. When Prince Joffrey seated himself to her right, she felt her throat tighten. \\nHe had not spoken a word to her since the awful thing had happened, and she had not dared to speak to \\nhim. At first she thought she hated him for what they\\'d done to Lady, but after Sansa had wept her eyes \\ndry, she told herself that it had not been Joffrey\\'s doing, not truly. The queen had done it; she was the one \\nto hate, her and Arya. Nothing bad would have happened except for Arya. \\nShe could not hate Joffrey tonight. He was too beautiful to hate. He wore a deep blue doublet studded \\nwith a double row of golden lion\\'s heads, and around his brow a slim coronet made of gold and \\nsapphires. His hair was as bright as the metal. Sansa looked at him and trembled, afraid that he might \\nignore her or, worse, turn hateful again and send her weeping from the table. \\nInstead Joffrey smiled and kissed her hand, handsome and gallant \\nas any prince in the songs, and said, \"Ser Loras has a keen eye for beauty, sweet lady.\" \\n\"He was too kind,\" she demurred, trying to remain modest and calm, though her heart was singing. \"Ser \\nLoras is a true knight. Do you think he will win tomorrow, my lord?\" \\n  198\\n\\n\"No,\" Jofftey said. \"My dog will do for him, or perhaps my uncle Jaime. And in a few years, when I am \\nold enough to enter the lists, I shall do for them all.\" He raised his hand to summon a servant with a flagon \\nof iced surnmerwine, and poured her a cup. She looked anxiously at Septa Mordane, until Jofftey leaned \\nover and filled the septa\\'s cup as well, so she nodded and thanked him graciously and said not another \\nword. \\nThe servants kept the cups filled all night, yet afterward Sansa could not recall ever tasting the wine. She \\nneeded no wine. She was drunk on the magic of the night, giddy with glamour, swept away by beauties \\nshe had dreamt of all her life and never dared hope to know. Singers sat before the king\\'s pavilion, filling \\nthe dusk with music. A juggler kept a cascade of burning clubs spinning through the air. The king\\'s own \\nfool, the pie-faced simpleton called Moon Boy, danced about on stilts, all in motley, making mock of \\neveryone with such deft cruelty that Sansa wondered if he was simple after all. Even Septa Mordane was \\nhelpless before him; when he sang his little song about the High Septon, she laughed so hard she spilled \\nwine on herself. \\nAnd Joffrey was the soul of courtesy. He talked to Sansa all night, showering her with compliments, \\nmaking her laugh, sharing little bits of court gossip, explaining Moon Boy\\'s japes. Sansa was so \\ncaptivated that she quite forgot all her courtesies and ignored Septa Mordane, seated to her left. \\nAll the while the courses came and went. A thick soup of barley and venison. Salads of sweetgrass and \\nspinach and plums, sprinkled with crushed nuts. Snails in honey and garlic. Sansa had never eaten snails \\nbefore; Jofftey showed her how to get the snail out of the shell, and fed her the first sweet morsel himself. \\nThen came trout fresh from the river, baked in clay; her prince helped her crack open the hard casing to \\nexpose the flaky white flesh within. And when the meat course was brought out, he served her himself, \\nslicing a queen\\'s portion from the joint, smiling as he laid it on her plate. She could see from the way he \\nmoved that his right arm was still troubling him, yet he uttered not a word of complaint. \\nLater came sweetbreads and pigeon pie and baked apples fragrant with cinnamon and lemon cakes \\nfrosted in sugar, but by then Sansa was so stuffed that she could not manage more than two little lemon \\ncakes, as much as she loved them. She was wondering whether she might attempt a third when the king \\nbegan to shout. \\nKing Robert had grown louder with each course. From time to time Sansa could hear him laughing or \\nroaring a command over the music and the clangor of plates and cutlery, but they were too far away for \\nher to make out his words. \\nNow everybody heard him. \"No, \" he thundered in a voice that drowned out all other speech. Sansa \\nwas shocked to see the king on his feet, red of face, reeling. He had a goblet of wine in one hand, and he \\nwas drunk as a man could be. \"You do not tell me what to do, woman,\" he screamed at Queen Cersei. \"I \\nam king here, do you understand? I rule here, and if I say that I will fight tomorrow, I will fight!\" \\nEveryone was staring. Sansa saw Ser Barristan, and the king\\'s brother Renly, and the short man who \\nhad talked to her so oddly and touched her hair, but no one made a move to interfere. The queen\\'s face \\nwas a mask, so bloodless that it might have been sculpted from snow. She rose from the table, gathered \\nher skirts around her, and stormed off in silence, servants trailing behind. \\nJaime Lannister put a hand on the king\\'s shoulder, but the king shoved him away hard. Lannister \\n  199\\n\\nstumbled and fell. The king guffawed. \"The great knight. I can still knock you in the dirt. Remember that, \\nKingslayer.\" He slapped his chest with the jeweled goblet, splashing wine all over his satin tunic. \"Give \\nme my hammer and not a man in the realm can stand before me!\" \\nJaime Lannister rose and brushed himself off. \"As you say, Your Grace.\" His voice was stiff. \\nLord Renly came forward, smiling. \"You\\'ve spilled your wine, Robert. Let me bring you a fresh goblet.\" \\nSansa started as Joffrey laid his hand on her arm. \"It grows late,\" the prince said. He had a queer look \\non his face, as if he were not seeing her at all. \"Do you need an escort back to the castle?\" \\n\"No,\" Sansa began. She looked for Septa Mordane, and was startled to find her with her head on the \\ntable, snoring soft and ladylike snores. \"I mean to say . . . yes, thank you, that would be most kind. I am \\ntired, and the way is so dark. I should be glad for some protection.\" \\nJoffrey called out, \"Dog!\" \\nSandor Clegane seemed to take form out of the night, so quickly did he appear. He had exchanged his \\narmor for a red woolen tunic with a leather dog\\'s head sewn on the front. The light of the torches made \\nhis burned face shine a dull red. \"Yes, Your Grace?\" he said. \\n\"Take my betrothed back to the castle, and see that no harm befalls \\nher,\" the prince told him brusquely. And without even a word of farewell, Joffrey strode off, leaving her \\nthere. \\nSansa could feel the Hound watching her. \"Did you think Joff was going to take you himself?\" He \\nlaughed. He had a laugh like the snarling of dogs in a pit. \"Small chance of that.\" He pulled her unresisting \\nto her feet. \"Come, you\\'re not the only one needs sleep. I\\'ve drunk too much, and I may need to kill my \\nbrother tomorrow.\" He laughed again. \\nSuddenly terrified, Sansa pushed at Septa Mordane\\'s shoulder, hoping to wake her, but she only snored \\nthe louder. King Robert had stumbled off and half the benches were suddenly empty. The feast was over, \\nand the beautiful dream had ended with it. \\nThe Hound snatched up a torch to light their way. Sansa followed close beside him. The ground was \\nrocky and uneven; the flickering light made it seem to shift and move beneath her. She kept her eyes \\nlowered, watching where she placed her feet. They walked among the pavilions, each with its banner and \\nits armor hung outside, the silence weighing heavier with every step. Sansa could not bear the sight of \\nhim, he frightened her so, yet she had been raised in all the ways of courtesy. A true lady would not \\nnotice his face, she told herself. \"You rode gallantly today, Ser Sandor,\" she made herself say. \\nSandor Clegane snarled at her. \"Spare me your empty little compliments, girl . . . and your ser\\'s. I am no \\nknight. I spit on them and their vows. My brother is a knight. Did you see him ride today?\" \\n\"Yes,\" Sansa whispered, trembling. \"He was \\n\"Gallant?\" the Hound finished. \\n  200\\n\\nHe was mocking her, she realized. \"No one could withstand him,\" she managed at last, proud of herself. \\nIt was no lie. \\nSandor Clegane stopped suddenly in the middle of a dark and empty field. She had no choice but to \\nstop beside him. \"Some septa trained you well. You\\'re like one of those birds from the Summer Isles, \\naren\\'t you? A pretty little talking -bird, repeating all the pretty little words they taught you to recite.\" \\n\"That\\'s unkind.\" Sansa could feel her heart fluttering in her chest. \"You\\'re frightening me. I want to go \\nnow.\" \\n\"No one could withstand him, \" the Hound rasped. \"That\\'s truth enough. No one could ever withstand \\nGregor. That boy today, his second joust, oh, that was a pretty bit of business. You saw that, did you? \\nFool boy, he had no business riding in this company. No money, no squire, no one to help him with that \\narmor. That gorget wasn\\'t fastened proper. You think Gregor didn\\'t notice that? You think Ser Gregor\\'s \\nlance rode up by chance, do you? Pretty little talking girl, you \\nbelieve that, you\\'re empty-headed as a bird for true. Gregor\\'s lance goes where Gregor wants it to go. \\nLook at me. Look at me!\" Sandor Clegane put a huge hand under her chin and forced her face up. He \\nsquatted in front of her, and moved the torch close. \"There\\'s a pretty for you. Take a good long stare. \\nYou know you want to. I\\'ve watched you turning away all the way down the kingsroad. Piss on that. \\nTake your look.\" \\nHis fingers held her jaw as hard as an iron trap. His eyes watched hers. Drunken eyes, sullen with anger. \\nShe had to look. \\nThe right side of his face was gaunt, with sharp cheekbones and a grey eye beneath a heavy brow. His \\nnose was large and hooked, his hair thin, dark. He wore it long and brushed it sideways, because no hair \\ngrew on the other side of that face. \\nThe left side of his face was a ruin. His ear had been burned away; there was nothing left but a hole. His \\neye was still good, but all around it was a twisted mass of scar, slick black flesh hard as leather, pocked \\nwith craters and fissured by deep cracks that gleamed red and wet when he moved. Down by his jaw, \\nyou could see a hint of bone where the flesh had been seared away. \\nSansa began to cry. He let go of her then, and snuffed out the torch in the dirt. \"No pretty words for \\nthat, girl? No little compliment the septa taught you?\" When there was no answer, he continued. \"Most of \\nthem, they think it was some battle. A siege, a burning tower, an enemy with a torch. One fool asked if it \\nwas dragonsbreath.\" His laugh was softer this time, but just as bitter. \"I\\'ll tell you what it was, girl,\" he \\nsaid, a voice from the night, a shadow leaning so close now that she could smell the sour stench of wine \\non his breath. \"I was younger than you, six, maybe seven. A woodcarver set up shop in the village under \\nmy father\\'s keep, and to buy favor he sent us gifts. The old man made marvelous toys. I don\\'t remember \\nwhat I got, but it was Gregor\\'s gift I wanted. A wooden knight, all painted up, every joint pegged \\nseparate and fixed with strings, so you could make him fight. Gregor is five years older than me, the toy \\nwas nothing to him, he was already a squire, near six foot tall and muscled like an ox. So I took his \\nknight, but there was no joy to it, I tell you. I was scared all the while, and true enough, he found me. \\nThere was a brazier in the room. Gregor never said a word, just picked me up under his arm and shoved \\nthe side of my face down in the burning coals and held me there while I screamed and screamed. You \\nsaw how strong he is. Even then, it took three grown men to drag him off me. The septons preach about \\nthe seven hells. What do they know? Only a man who\\'s been burned knows what hell is truly like. \\n'"

       "'we have a long ride before us gared pointed out eight days maybe nine and night is falling ser waymar royce glanced at the sky with disinterest it does that every day about this time are you unmanned by the dark gared will could see the tightness around gareds mouth the barely sup pressed anger in his eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak gared had spent forty years in the nights watch man and boy and he was not accustomed to being made light of yet it was more than that under the wounded pride will could sense something else in the older man you could taste it a nervous tension that came perilous close to fear will shared his unease he had been four years on the wall the first time he had been sent beyond all the old stories had come rushing back and his bowels had turned to water he had laughed about it afterward he was a veteran of a hundred rangings by now and the endless dark wilderness that the southron called the haunted forest had no more terrors for him until tonight something was different tonight there was an edge to this darkness that made his hackles rise nine days they had been riding north and northwest and then north again farther and farther from the wall hard on the track of a band of wildling raiders each day had been worse than the day that had come before it today was the worst of all a cold wind was blowing out of the north and it made the trees rustle like living things all day will had felt as though something were watching him something cold and implacable that loved him not gared had felt it too will wanted nothing so much as to ride hellbent for the safety of the wall but that was not a feeling to share with your commander especially not a commander like this one ser waymar royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs he was a handsome youth of eighteen grey eyed and graceful and slender as a knife mounted on his huge black destrier the knight towered above will and gared on their smaller garrons he wore black leather boots black woolen pants black moleskin gloves and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of black wool and boiled leather ser waymar had been a sworn brother of the nights watch for less than half a year but no one could say he had not prepared for his vocation at least insofar as his wardrobe was concerned his cloak was his crowning glory sable thick and black and soft as sin bet he killed them all himself he did gared told the barracks over wine twisted their little heads off our mighty warrior they had all shared the laugh it is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups will reflected as he sat shivering atop his garron gared must have felt the same mormont said as we should track them and we did gared said theyre dead they shant trouble us no more theres hard riding before us i dont like this weather if it snows we could be a fortnight getting back and snows the best we can hope for ever seen an ice storm my lord the lordling seemed not to hear him he studied the deepening twilight in that half bored half distracted way he had will had ridden with the knight long enough to understand that it was best not to interrupt him when he looked like that tell me again what you saw will all the details leave nothing out will had been a hunter before he joined the nights watch well a poacher in truth mallister freeriders had caught him red handed in the mallisters own woods skinning one of the mallisters own bucks and it had been a choice of putting on the black or losing a hand no one could move through the woods as silent as will and it had not taken the black brothers long to discover his talent the camp is two miles farther on over that ridge hard beside a stream will said i got close as i dared theres eight of them men and women both no children i could see they put up a lean to against the rock the snows pretty well covered it now but i could still make it out no fire burning but the firepit was still plain as day no one moving i watched a long time no living man ever lay so still did you see any blood well no will admitted did you see any weapons some swords a few bows one man had an axe heavy looking double bladed a cruel piece of iron it was on the ground beside him right by his hand did you make note of the position of the bodies will shrugged a couple are sitting up against the rock most of them on the ground fallen like or sleeping royce suggested fallen will insisted theres one woman up an ironwood halfhid in the branches a far eyes he smiled thinly i took care she never saw me when i got closer i saw that she wasnt moving neither despite himself he shivered you have a chill royce asked some will muttered the wind mlord the young knight turned back to his grizzled man at arms frostfallen leaves whispered past them and royces destrier moved restlessly what do you think might have killed these men gared ser waymar asked casually he adjusted the drape of his long sable cloak it was the cold gared said with iron certainty i saw men freeze last winter and the one before when i was half a boy everyone talks about snows forty foot deep and how the ice wind comes howling out of the north but the real enemy is the cold it steals up on you quieter than will and at first you shiver and your teeth chatter and you stamp your feet and dream of mulled wine and nice hot fires it burns it does nothing burns like the cold but only for a while then it gets inside you and starts to fill you up and after a while you dont have the strength to fight it its easier just to sit down or go to sleep they say you dont feel any pain toward the end first you go weak and drowsy and everything starts to fade and then its like sinking into a sea of warm milk peaceful like such eloquence gared ser waymar observed i never suspected you had it in you ive had the cold in me too lordling gared pulled back his hood giving ser waymar a good long look at the stumps where his ears had been two ears three toes and the little finger off my left hand i got off light we found my brother frozen at his watch with a smile on his face ser waymar shrugged you ought dress more warmly gared gared glared at the lordling the scars around his ear holes flushed red with anger where maester aemon had cut the ears away well see how warm you can dress when the winter comes he pulled up his hood and hunched over his garron silent and sullen if gared said it was the cold will began have you drawn any watches this past week will yes mlord there never was a week when he did not draw a dozen bloody watches what was the man driving at and how did you find the wall weeping will said frowning he saw it clear enough now that the lordling had pointed it out they couldnt have froze not if the wall was weeping it wasnt cold enough royce nodded bright lad weve had a few light frosts this past week and a quick flurry of snow now and then but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight grown men men clad in fur and leather let me remind you with shelter near at hand and the means of making fire the knights smile was cocksure will lead us there i would see these dead men for myself and then there was nothing to be done for it the order had been given and honor bound them to obey will went in front his shaggy little garron picking the way carefully through the undergrowth a light snow had fallen the night before and there were stones and roots and hidden sinks lying just under its crust waiting for the careless and the unwary ser waymar royce came next his great black destrier snorting impatiently the warhorse was the wrong mount for ranging but try and tell that to the lordling gared brought up the rear the old man at arms muttered to himself as he rode twilight deepened the cloudless sky turned a deep purple the color of an old bruise then faded to black the stars began to come out a half moon rose will was grateful for the light we can make a better pace than this surely royce said when the moon was full risen not with this horse will said fear had made him insolent perhaps my lord would care to take the lead ser waymar royce did not deign to reply somewhere off in the wood a wolf howled will pulled his garron over beneath an ancient gnarled ironwood and dismounted why are you stopping ser waymar asked best go the rest of the way on foot mlord its just over that ridge royce paused a moment staring off into the distance his face reflective a cold wind whispered through the trees his great sable cloak stirred behind like something half alive theres something wrong here gared muttered the young knight gave him a disdainful smile is there cant you feel it gared asked listen to the darkness will could feel it four years in the nights watch and he had never been so afraid what was it wind trees rustling a wolf which sound is it that unmans you so gared when gared did not answer royce slid gracefully from his saddle he tied the destrier securely to a low hanging limb well away from the other horses and drew his longsword from its sheath jewels glittered in its hilt and the moonlight ran down the shining steel it was a splendid weapon castle forged and new made from the look of it will doubted it had ever been swung in anger the trees press close here will warned that sword will tangle you up m ord better a knife if i need instruction i will ask for it the young lord said gared stay here guard the horses gared dismounted we need a fire ill see to it how big a fool are you old man if there are enemies in this wood a fire is the last thing we want theres some enemies a fire will keep away gared said bears and direwolves and and other things ser waymars mouth became a hard line no fire gareds hood shadowed his face but will could see the hard glitter in his eyes as he stared at the knight for a moment he was afraid the older man would go for his sword it was a short ugly thing its grip discolored by sweat its edge nicked from hard use but will would not have given an iron bob for the lordlings life if gared pulled it from its scabbard finally gared looked down no fire he muttered low under his breath royce took it for acquiescence and turned away lead on he said to will will threaded their way through a thicket then started up the slope to the low ridge where he had found his vantage point under a sentinel tree under the thin crust of snow the ground was damp and muddy slick footing with rocks and hidden roots to trip you up will made no sound as he climbed behind him he heard the soft metallic slither of the lordlings ringmail the rustle of leaves and muttered curses as reaching branches grabbed at his longsword and tugged on his splendid sable cloak the great sentinel was right there at the top of the ridge where will had known it would be its lowest branches a bare foot off the ground will slid in underneath flat on his belly in the snow and the mud and looked down on the empty clearing below his heart stopped in his chest for a moment he dared not breathe moonlight shone down on the clearing the ashes of the firepit the snow covered lean to the great rock the little half frozen stream everything was just as it had been a few hours ago they were gone all the bodies were gone gods he heard behind him a sword slashed at a branch as ser waymar royce gained the ridge he stood there beside the sentinel longsword in hand his cloak billowing behind him as the wind came up outlined nobly against the stars for all to see get down will whispered urgently somethings wrong royce did not move he looked down at the empty clearing and laughed your dead men seem to have moved camp will wills voice abandoned him he groped for words that did not come it was not possible his eyes swept back and forth over the abandoned campsite stopped on the axe a huge double bladed battle axe still lying where he had seen it last untouched a valuable weapon on your feet will ser waymar commanded theres no one here i wont have you hiding under a bush reluctantly will obeyed ser waymar looked him over with open disapproval i am not going back to castle black a failure on my first ranging we will find these men he glanced around up the tree be quick about it look for a fire will turned away wordless there was no use to argue the wind was moving it cut right through him he went to the tree a vaulting grey green sentinel and began to climb soon his hands were sticky with sap and he was lost among the needles fear filled his gut like a meal he could not digest he whispered a prayer to the nameless gods of the wood and slipped his dirk free of its sheath he put it between his teeth to keep both hands free for climbing the taste of cold iron in his mouth gave him comfort down below the lordling called out suddenly who goes there will heard uncertainty in the challenge he stopped climbing he listened he watched the woods gave answer the rustle of leaves the icy rush of the stream a distant hoot of a snow owl the others made no sound will saw movement from the corner of his eye pale shapes gliding through the wood he turned his head glimpsed a white shadow in the darkness then it was gone branches stirred gently in the wind scratching at one another with wooden fingers will opened his mouth to call down a warning and the words seemed to freeze in his throat perhaps he was wrong perhaps it had only been a bird a reflection on the snow some trick of the moonlight what had he seen after all will where are you ser waymar called up can you see anything he was turning in a slow circle suddenly wary his sword in hand he must have felt them as will felt them there was nothing to see answer me why is it so cold it was cold shivering will clung more tightly to his perch his face pressed hard against the trunk of the sentinel he could feel the sweet sticky sap on his cheek a shadow emerged from the dark of the wood it stood in front of royce tall it was and gaunt and hard as old bones with flesh pale as milk its armor seemed to change color as it moved here it was white as new fallen snow there black as shadow everywhere dappled with the deep grey green of the trees the patterns ran like moonlight on water with every step it took will heard the breath go out of ser waymar royce in a long hiss come no farther the lordling warned his voice cracked like a boys he threw the long sable cloak back over his shoulders to free his arms for battle and took his sword in both hands the wind had stopped it was very cold the other slid forward on silent feet in its hand was a longsword like none that will had ever seen no human metal had gone into the forging of that blade it was alive with moonlight translucent a shard of crystal so thin that it seemed almost to vanish when seen edge on there was a faint blue shimmer to the thing a ghost light that played around its edges and somehow will knew it was sharper than any razor ser waymar met him bravely dance with me then he lifted his sword high over his head defiant his hands trembled from the weight of it or perhaps from the cold yet in that moment will thought he was a boy no longer but a man of the nights watch the other halted will saw its eyes blue deeper and bluer than any human eyes a blue that burned like ice they fixed on the longsword trembling on high watched the moonlight running cold along the metal for a heartbeat he dared to hope they emerged silently from the shadows twins to the first three of them four five ser waymar may have felt the cold that came with them but he never saw them never heard them will had to call out it was his duty and his death if he did he shivered and hugged the tree and kept the silence the pale sword came shivering through the air ser waymar met it with steel when the blades met there was no ring of metal on metal only a high thin sound at the edge of hearing like an animal screaming in pain royce checked a second blow and a third then fell back a step another flurry of blows and he fell back again behind him to right to left all around him the watchers stood patient faceless silent the shifting patterns of their delicate armor making them all but invisible in the wood yet they made no move to interfere again and again the swords met until will wanted to cover his ears against the strange anguished keening of their clash ser waymar was panting from the effort now his breath steaming in the moonlight his blade was white with frost the others danced with pale blue light then royces parry came a beat too late the pale sword bit through the ringmail beneath his arm the young lord cried out in pain blood welled between the rings it steamed in the cold and the droplets seemed red as fire where they touched the snow ser waymars fingers brushed his side his moleskin glove came away soaked with red the other said something in a language that will did not know his voice was like the cracking of ice on a winter lake and the words were mocking ser waymar royce found his fury for robert he shouted and he came up snarling lifting the frost covered longsword with both hands and swinging it around in a flat sidearm slash with all his weight behind it the others parry was almost lazy when the blades touched the steel shattered a scream echoed through the forest night and the longsword shivered into a hundred brittle pieces the shards scattering like a rain of needles royce went to his knees shrieking and covered his eyes blood welled between his fingers the watchers moved forward together as if some signal had been given swords rose and fell all in a deathly silence it was cold butchery the pale blades sliced through ringmail as if it were silk will closed his eyes far beneath him he heard their voices and laughter sharp as icicles when he found the courage to look again a long time had passed and the ridge below was empty he stayed in the tree scarce daring to breathe while the moon crept slowly across the black sky finally his muscles cramping and his fingers numb with cold he climbed down royces body lay facedown in the snow one arm outflung the thick sable cloak had been slashed in a dozen places lying dead like that you saw how young he was a boy he found what was left of the sword a few feet away the end splintered and twisted like a tree struck by lightning will knelt looked around warily and snatched it up the broken sword would be his proof gared would know what to make of it and if not him then surely that old bear mormont or maester aemon would gared still be waiting with the horses he had to hurry will rose ser waymar royce stood over him his fine clothes were a tatter his face a ruin a shard from his sword transfixed the blind white pupil of his left eye the right eye was open the pupil burned blue it saw the broken sword fell from nerveless fingers will closed his eyes to pray long elegant hands brushed his cheek then tightened around his throat they were gloved in the finest moleskin and sticky with blood yet the touch was icy cold bran the morning had dawned clear and cold with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer they set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded twenty in all and bran rode among them nervous with excitement this was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to see the kings justice done it was the ninth year of summer and the seventh of brans life the man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills robb thought he was a wildling his sword sworn to mance rayder the kingbeyond the wall it made brans skin prickle to think of it he remembered the hearth tales old nan told them the wildlings were cruel men she said slavers and slayers and thieves they consorted with giants and ghouls stole girl children in the dead of night and drank blood from polished horns and their women lay with the others in the long night to sire terrible half human children but the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the kings justice was old and scrawny not much taller than robb he had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite and he dressed all in black the same as a brother of the nights watch except that his furs were ragged and greasy the breath of man and horse mingled steaming in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut down from the wall and dragged before them robb and jon sat tall and still on their horses with bran between them on his pony trying to seem older than seven trying to pretend that hed seen all this before a faint wind blew through the holdfast gate over their heads flapped the banner of the starks of winterfell a grey direwolf racing across an ice white field brans father sat solemnly on his horse long brown hair stirring in the wind his closely trimmed beard was shot with white making him look older than his thirty five years he had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest he had taken off fathers face bran thought and donned the face of lord stark of winterfell there were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning but afterward bran could not recall much of what had been said finally his lord father gave a command and two of his guardsmen dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square they forced his head down onto the hard black wood lord eddard stark dismounted and his ward theon greyjoy brought forth the sword ice that sword was called it was as wide across as a mans hand and taller even than robb the blade was valyrian steel spell forged and dark as smoke nothing held an edge like valyrian steel his father peeled off his gloves and handed them to jory cassel the captain of his household guard he took hold of ice with both hands and said in the name of robert of the house baratheon the first of his name king of the andals and the rhoynar and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm by the word of eddard of the house stark lord of winterfell and warden of the north i do sentence you to die he lifted the greatsword high above his head brans bastard brother jon snow moved closer keep the pony well in hand he whispered and dont look away father will know if you do bran kept his pony well in hand and did not look away his father took off the mans head with a single sure stroke blood sprayed out across the snow as red as surnmerwine one of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting bran could not take his eyes off the blood the snows around the stump drank it eagerly reddening as he watched the head bounced off a thick root and rolled it came up near greyjoys feet theon was a lean dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing he laughed put his boot on the head and kicked it away ass jon muttered low enough so greyjoy did not hear he put a hand on brans shoulder and bran looked over at his bastard brother you did well jon told him solemnly jon was fourteen an old hand at justice it seemed colder on the long ride back to winterfell though the wind had died by then and the sun was higher in the sky bran rode with his brothers well ahead of the main party his pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses the deserter died bravely robb said he was big and broad and growing every day with his mothers coloring the fair skin red brown hair and blue eyes of the tullys of riverrun he had courage at the least no jon snow said quietly it was not courage this one was dead of fear you could see it in his eyes stark jons eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black but there was little they did not see he was of an age with robb but they did not look alike jon was slender where robb was muscular dark where robb was fair graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast robb was not impressed the others take his eyes he swore he died well race you to the bridge done jon said kicking his horse forward robb cursed and followed and they galloped off down the trail robb laughing and hooting jon silent and intent the hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went bran did not try to follow his pony could not keep up he had seen the ragged mans eyes and he was thinking of them now after a while the sound of robbs laughter receded and the woods grew silent again so deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride beside him are you well bran he asked not unkindly yes father bran told him he looked up wrapped in his furs and leathers mounted on his great warhorse his lord father loomed over him like a giant robb says the man died bravely but jon says he was afraid what do you think his father asked bran thought about it can a man still be brave if hes afraid that is the only time a man can be brave his father told him do you understand why i did it he was a wildling bran said they carry off women and sell them to the others his lord father smiled old nan has been telling you stories again in truth the man was an oathbreaker a deserter from the nights watch no man is more dangerous the deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken so he will not flinch from any crime no matter how vile but you mistake me the question was not why the man had to die but why i must do it bran had no answer for that king robert has a headsman he said uncertainly he does his father admitted as did the targaryen kings before him yet our way is the older way the blood of the first men still flows in the veins of the starks and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword if you would take a mans life you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words and if you cannot bear to do that then perhaps the man does not deserve to die one day bran you will be robbs bannerman holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king and justice will fall to you when that day comes you must take no pleasure in the task but neither must you look away a ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is that was when jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them he waved and shouted down at them father bran come quickly see what robb has found then he was gone again jory rode up beside them trouble my lord beyond a doubt his lord father said come let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now he sent his horse into a trot jory and bran and the rest came after they found robb on the riverbank north of the bridge with jon still mounted beside him the late summer snows had been heavy this moonturn robb stood knee deep in white his hood pulled back so the sun shone in his hair he was cradling something in his arm while the boys talked in hushed excited voices the riders picked their way carefully through the drifts groping for solid footing on the hidden uneven ground jory cassel and theon greyjoy were the first to reach the boys greyjoy was laughing and joking as he rode bran heard the breath go out of him gods he exclaimed struggling to keep control of his horse as he reached for his sword jorys sword was already out robb get away from it he called as his horse reared under him robb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms she cant hurt you he said shes dead jory bran was afire with curiosity by then he would have spurred the pony faster but his father made them dismount beside the bridge and approach on foot bran jumped off and ran by then jon jory and theon greyjoy had all dismounted as well what in the seven hells is it greyjoy was saying a wolf robb told him a freak greyjoy said look at the size of it brans heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waist high drift to his brothers side half buried in bloodstained snow a huge dark shape slumped in death ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a womans perfume bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth but it was the size of it that made him gasp it was bigger than his pony twice the size of the largest hound in his fathers kennel its no freak jon said calmly thats a direwolf they grow larger than the other kind theon greyjoy said theres not been a direwolf sighted south of the wall in two hundred years i see one now jon replied bran tore his eyes away from the monster that was when he noticed the bundle in robbs arms he gave a cry of delight and moved closer the pup was a tiny ball of grey black fur its eyes still closed it nuzzled blindly against robbs chest as he cradled it searching for milk among his leathers making a sad little whimpery sound bran reached out hesitantly go on robb told him you can touch him bran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke then turned as jon said here you go his half brother put a second pup into his arms there are five of them bran sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup to his face its fur was soft and warm against his cheek direwolves loose in the realm after so many years muttered hullen the master of horse i like it not it is a sign jory said father frowned this is only a dead animal jory he said yet he seemed troubled snow crunched under his boots as he moved around the body do we know what killed her theres something in the throat robb told him proud to have found the answer before his father even asked there just under the jaw his father knelt and groped under the beasts head with his hand he gave a yank and held it up for all to see a foot of shattered antler tines snapped off all wet with blood a sudden silence descended over the party the men looked at the antler uneasily and no one dared to speak even bran could sense their fear though he did not understand his father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow im surprised she lived long enough to whelp he said his voice broke the spell maybe she didnt jory said ive heard tales maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups came born with the dead another man put in worse luck no matter said hullen they be dead soon enough too bran gave a wordless cry of dismay the sooner the better theon greyjoy agreed he drew his sword give the beast here bran the little thing squirmed against him as if it heard and understood no bran cried out fiercely its mine put away your sword greyjoy robb said for a moment he sounded as commanding as their father like the lord he would someday be we will keep these pups you cannot do that boy said harwin who was hullens son it be a mercy to kill them hullen said bran looked to his lord father for rescue but got only a frown a furrowed brow hullen speaks truly son better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation no he could feel tears welling in his eyes and he looked away he did not want to cry in front of his father robb resisted stubbornly ser rodriks red bitch whelped again last week he said it was a small litter only two live pups shell have milk enough shell rip them apart when they try to nurse lord stark jon said it was strange to hear him call father that so formal bran looked at him with desperate hope there are five pups he told father three male two female what of it jon you have five trueborn children jon said three sons two daughters the direwolf is the sigil of your house your children were meant to have these pups my lord bran saw his fathers face change saw the other men exchange glances he loved jon with all his heart at that moment even at seven bran understood what his brother had done the count had come right only because jon had omitted himself he had included the girls included even rickon the baby but not the bastard who bore the surname snow the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own their father understood as well you want no pup for yourself jon he asked softly the direwolf graces the banners of house stark jon pointed out i am no stark father their lord father regarded jon thoughtfully robb rushed into the silence he left i will nurse him myself father he promised i will soak a towel with warm milk and give him suck from that me too bran echoed the lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes easy to say and harder to do i will not have you wasting the servants time with this if you want these pups you will feed them yourselves is that understood bran nodded eagerly the pup squirmed in his grasp licked at his face with a warm tongue you must train them as well their father said you must train them the kennelmaster will have nothing to do with these monsters i promise you that and the gods help you if you neglect them or brutalize them or train them badly these are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick a direwolf will rip a mans arm off his shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat are you sure you want this yes father bran said yes robb agreed the pups may die anyway despite all you do they wont die robb said we wont let them die keep them then jory desmond gather up the other pups its time we were back to winterfell it was not until they were mounted and on their way that bran allowed himself to taste the sweet air of victory by then his pup was snuggled inside his leathers warm against him safe for the long ride home bran was wondering what to name him halfway across the bridge jon pulled up suddenly what is it jon their lord father asked cant you hear it bran could hear the wind in the trees the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks the whimpering of his hungry pup but jon was listening to something else there jon said he swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge they watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow watched him kneel a moment later he was riding back to them smiling he must have crawled away from the others jon said or been driven away their father said looking at the sixth pup his fur was white where the rest of the litter was grey his eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind an albino theon greyjoy said with wry amusement this one will die even faster than the others jon snow gave his fathers ward a long chilling look i think not greyjoy he said this one belongs to me catelyn catelyn had never liked this godswood she had been born a tully at riverrun far to the south on the red fork of the trident the godswood there was a garden bright and airy where tall redwoods spread dappled shadows across tinkling streams birds sang from hidden nests and the air was spicy with the scent of flowers the gods of winterfell kept a different sort of wood it was a dark primal place three acres of old forest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around it it smelled of moist earth and decay no redwoods grew here this was a wood of stubborn sentinel trees armored in grey green needles of mighty oaks of ironwoods as old as the realm itself here thick black trunks crowded close together while twisted branches wove a dense canopy overhead and misshappen roots wrestled beneath the soil this was a place of deep silence and brooding shadows and the gods who lived here had no names but she knew she would find her husband here tonight whenever he took a mans life afterward he would seek the quiet of the godswood catelyn had been anointed with the seven oils and named in the rainbow of light that filled the sept of riverrun she was of the faith like her father and grandfather and his father before him her gods had names and their faces were as familiar as the faces of her parents worship was a septon with a censer the smell of incense a seven sided crystal alive with light voices raised in song the tullys kept a godswood as all the great houses did but it was only a place to walk or read or lie in the sun worship was for the sept for her sake ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven faces of god but the blood of the first men still flowed in the veins of the starks and his own gods were the old ones the nameless faceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the vanished children of the forest at the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black and cold the heart tree ned called it the weirwoods bark was white as bone its leaves dark red like a thousand bloodstained hands a face had been carved in the trunk of the great tree its features long and melancholy the deep cut eyes red with dried sap and strangely watchful they were old those eyes older than winterfell itself they had seen brandon the builder set the first stone if the tales were true they had watched the castles granite walls rise around them it was said that the children of the forest had carved the faces in the trees during the dawn centuries before the coming of the first men across the narrow sea in the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a thousand years ago except on the isle of faces where the green men kept their silent watch up here it was different here every castle had its godswood and every godswood had its heart tree and every heart tree its face catelyn found her husband beneath the weirwood seated on a moss covered stone the greatsword ice was across his lap and he was cleaning the blade in those waters black as night a thousand years of humus lay thick upon the godswood floor swallowing the sound of her feet but the red eyes of the weirwood seemed to follow her as she came ned she called softly he lifted his head to look at her catelyn he said his voice was distant and formal where are the children he would always ask her that in the kitchen arguing about names for the wolf pups she spread her cloak on the forest floor and sat beside the pool her back to the weirwood she could feel the eyes watching her but she did her best to ignore them arya is already in love and sansa is charmed and gracious but rickon is not quite sure is he afraid ned asked a little she admitted he is only three ned frowned he must learn to face his fears he will not be three forever and winter is coming yes catelyn agreed the words gave her a chill as they always did the stark words every noble house had its words family mottoes touchstones prayers of sorts they boasted of honor and glory promised loyalty and truth swore faith and courage all but the starks winter is coming said the stark words not for the first time she reflected on what a strange people these northerners were the man died well ill give him that ned said he had a swatch of oiled leather in one hand he ran it lightly up the greatsword as he spoke polishing the metal to a dark glow i was glad for brans sake you would have been proud of bran i am always proud of bran catelyn replied watching the sword as he stroked it she could see the rippling deep within the steel where the metal had been folded back on itself a hundred times in the forging catelyn had no love for swords but she could not deny that ice had its own beauty it had been forged in valyria before the doom had come to the old freehold when the ironsmiths had worked their metal with spells as well as hammers four hundred years old it was and as sharp as the day it was forged the name it bore was older still a legacy from the age of heroes when the starks were kings in the north he was the fourth this year ned said grimly the poor man was half mad something had put a fear in him so deep that my words could not reach him he sighed ben writes that the strength of the nights watch is down below a thousand its not only desertions they are losing men on rangings as well is it the wildlings she asked who else ned lifted ice looked down the cool steel length of it and it will only grow worse the day may come when i will have no choice but to call the banners and ride north to deal with this kingbeyond the wall for good and all beyond the wall the thought made catelyn shudder ned saw the dread on her face mance rayder is nothing for us to fear there are darker things beyond the wall she glanced behind her at the heart tree the pale bark and red eyes watching listening thinking its long slow thoughts his smile was gentle you listen to too many of old nans stories the others are as dead as the children of the forest gone eight thousand years maester luwin will tell you they never lived at all no living man has ever seen one until this morning no living man had ever seen a direwolf either catelyn reminded him i ought to know better than to argue with a tully he said with a rueful smile he slid ice back into its sheath you did not come here to tell me crib tales i know how little you like this place what is it my lady catelyn took her husbands hand there was grievous news today my lord i did not wish to trouble you until you had cleansed yourself there was no way to soften the blow so she told him straight i am so sorry my love jon arryn is dead his eyes found hers and she could see how hard it took him as she had known it would in his youth ned had fostered at the eyrie and the childless lord arryn had become a second father to him and his fellow ward robert baratheon when the mad king aerys targaryen had demanded their heads the lord of the eyrie had raised his moon and falcon banners in revolt rather than give up those he had pledged to protect and one day fifteen years ago this second father had become a brother as well as he and ned stood together in the sept at riverrun to wed two sisters the daughters of lord hoster tully jon he said is this news certain it was the kings seal and the letter is in roberts own hand i saved it for you he said lord arryn was taken quickly even maester pycelle was helpless but he brought the milk of the poppy so jon did not linger long in pain that is some small mercy i suppose he said she could see the grief on his face but even then he thought first of her your sister he said and jons boy what word of them the message said only that they were well and had returned to the eyrie catelyn said i wish they had gone to riverrun instead the eyrie is high and lonely and it was ever her husbands place not hers lord jons memory will haunt each stone i know my sister she needs the comfort of family and friends around her your uncle waits in the vale does he not jon named him knight of the gate id heard catelyn nodded brynden will do what he can for her and for the boy that is some comfort but still go to her ned urged take the children fill her halls with noise and shouts and laughter that boy of hers needs other children about him and lysa should not be alone in her grief would that i could catelyn said the letter had other tidings the king is riding to winterfell to seek you out it took ned a moment to comprehend her words but when the understanding came the darkness left his eyes robert is coming here when she nodded a smile broke across his face catelyn wished she could share his joy but she had heard the talk in the yards a direwolf dead in the snow a broken antler in its throat dread coiled within her like a snake but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved this man who put no faith in signs i knew that would please you she said we should send word to your brother on the wall yes of course he agreed ben will want to be here i shall tell maester luwin to send his swiftest bird ned rose and pulled her to her feet damnation how many years has it been and he gives us no more notice than this how many in his party did the message say i should think a hundred knights at the least with all their retainers and half again as many freeriders cersei and the children travel with them robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes he said it is just as well that will give us more time to prepare the queens brothers are also in the party she told him ned grimaced at that there was small love between him and the queens family catelyn knew the lannisters of casterly rock had come late to roberts cause when victory was all but certain and he had never forgiven them well if the price for roberts company is an infestation of lannisters so be it it sounds as though robert is bringing half his court where the king goes the realm follows she said it will be good to see the children the youngest was still sucking at the lannister womans teat the last time i saw him he must be what five by now prince tornmen is seven she told him the same age as bran please ned guard your tongue the lannister woman is our queen and her pride is said to grow with every passing year ned squeezed her hand there must be a feast of course with singers and robert will want to hunt i shall send jory south with an honor guard to meet them on the kingsroad and escort them back gods how are we going to feed them all on his way already you said damn the man damn his royal hide daenerys her brother held the gown up for her inspection this is beauty touch it go on caress the fabric dany touched it the cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like water she could not remember ever wearing anything so soft it frightened her she pulled her hand away is it really mine a gift from the magister illyrio viserys said smiling her brother was in a high mood tonight the color will bring out the violet in your eyes and you shall have gold as well and jewels of all sorts illyrio has promised tonight you must look like a princess a princess dany thought she had forgotten what that was like perhaps she had never really known why does he give us so much she asked what does he want from us for nigh on half a year they had lived in the magisters house eating his food pampered by his servants dany was thirteen old enough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price here in the free city of pentos illyrio is no fool viserys said he was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in his pale lilac eyes the magister knows that i will not forget my friends when i come into my throne dany said nothing magister illyrio was a dealer in spices gemstones dragonbone and other less savory things he had friends in all of the nine free cities it was said and even beyond in vaes dothrak and the fabled lands beside the jade sea it was also said that hed never had a friend he wouldnt cheerfully sell for the right price dany listened to the talk in the streets and she heard these things but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream his anger was a terrible thing when roused viserys called it waking the dragon her brother hung the gown beside the door illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you be sure you wash off the stink of the stables khal drogo has a thousand horses tonight he looks for a different sort of mount he studied her critically you still slouch straighten yourself he pushed back her shoulders with his hands let them see that you have a womans shape now his fingers brushed lightly over her budding breasts and tightened on a nipple you will not fail me tonight if you do it will go hard for you you dont want to wake the dragon do you his fingers twisted her the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic do you he repeated no dany said meekly her brother smiled good he touched her hair almost with affection when they write the history of my reign sweet sister they will say that it began tonight when he was gone dany went to her window and looked out wistfully on the waters of the bay the square brick towers of pentos were black silhouettes outlined against the setting sun dany could hear the singing of the red priests as they lit their night fires and the shouts of ragged children playing games beyond the walls of the estate for a moment she wished she could be out there with them barefoot and breathless and dressed in tatters with no past and no future and no feast to attend at khal drogos manse somewhere beyond the sunset across the narrow sea lay a land of green hills and flowered plains and great rushing rivers where towers of dark stone rose amidst magnificent blue grey mountains and armored knights rode to battle beneath the banners of their lords the dothraki called that land rhaesh andahli the land of the andals in the free cities they talked of westeros and the sunset kingdoms her brother had a simpler name our land he called it the words were like a prayer with him if he said them enough the gods were sure to hear ours by blood right taken from us by treachery but ours still ours forever you do not steal from the dragon oh no the dragon remembers and perhaps the dragon did remember but dany could not she had never seen this land her brother said was theirs this realm beyond the narrow sea these places he talked of casterly rock and the eyrie highgarden and the vale of arryn dorne and the isle of faces they were just words to her viserys had been a boy of eight when they fled kings landing to escape the advancing armies of the usurper but daenerys had been only a quickening in their mothers womb yet sometimes dany would picture the way it had been so often had her brother told her the stories the midnight flight to dragonstone moonlight shimmering on the ships black sails her brother rhaegar battling the usurper in the bloody waters of the trident and dying for the woman he loved the sack of kings landing by the ones viserys called the usurpers dogs the lords lannister and stark princess elia of dorne pleading for mercy as rhaegars heir was ripped from her breast and murdered before her eyes the polished skulls of the last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room while the kingslayer opened fathers throat with a golden sword she had been born on dragonstone nine moons after their flight while a raging summer storm threatened to rip the island fastness apart they said that storm was terrible the targaryen fleet was smashed while it lay at anchor and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild waters of the narrow sea her mother had died birthing her and for that her brother viserys had never forgiven her she did not remember dragonstone either they had run again just before the usurpers brother set sail with his new built fleet by then only dragonstone itself the ancient seat of their house had remained of the seven kingdoms that had once been theirs it would not remain for long the garrison had been prepared to sell them to the usurper but one night ser willem darry and four loyal men had broken into the nursery and stolen them both along with her wet nurse and set sail under cover of darkness for the safety of the braavosian coast she remembered ser willem dimly a great grey bear of a man halfblind roaring and bellowing orders from his sickbed the servants had lived in terror of him but he had always been kind to dany he called her little princess and sometimes my lady and his hands were soft as old leather he never left his bed though and the smell of sickness clung to him day and night a hot moist sickly sweet odor that was when they lived in braavos in the big house with the red door dany had her own room there with a lemon tree outside her window after ser willem had died the servants had stolen what little money they had left and soon after they had been put out of the big house dany had cried when the red door closed behind them forever they had wandered since then from braavos to myr from myr to tyrosh and on to qohor and volantis and lys never staying long in any one place her brother would not allow it the usurpers hired knives were close behind them he insisted though dany had never seen one at first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last targaryens to their homes and tables but as the years passed and the usurper continued to sit upon the iron throne doors closed and their lives grew meaner years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures and now even the coin they had gotten from mothers crown had gone in the alleys and wine sinks of pentos they called her brother the beggar king dany did not want to know what they called her we will have it all back someday sweet sister he would promise her sometimes his hands shook when he talked about it the jewels and the silks dragonstone and kings landing the iron throne and the seven kingdoms all they have taken from us we will have it back viserys lived for that day all that daenerys wanted back was the big house with the red door the lemon tree outside her window the childhood she had never known there came a soft knock on her door come dany said turning away from the window illyrios servants entered bowed and set about their business they were slaves a gift from one of the magisters many dothraki friends there was no slavery in the free city of pentos nonetheless they were slaves the old woman small and grey as a mouse never said a word but the girl made up for it she was illyrios favorite a fair haired blue eyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as she worked they filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented it with fragrant oils the girl pulled the rough cotton tunic over danys head and helped her into the tub the water was scalding hot but daenerys did not flinch or cry out she liked the heat it made her feel clean besides her brother had often told her that it was never too hot for a targaryen ours is the house of the dragon he would say the fire is in our blood the old woman washed her long silver pale hair and gently combed out the snags all in silence the girl scrubbed her back and her feet and told her how lucky she was drogo is so rich that even his slaves wear golden collars a hundred thousand men ride in his khalasar and his palace in vaes dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver there was more like that so much more what a handsome man the khal was so tall and fierce fearless in battle the best rider ever to mount a horse a demon archer daenerys said nothing she had always assumed that she would wed viserys when she came of age for centuries the targaryens had married brother to sister since aegon the conqueror had taken his sisters to bride the line must be kept pure viserys had told her a thousand times theirs was the kingsblood the golden blood of old valyria the blood of the dragon dragons did not mate with the beasts of the field and targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of lesser men yet now viserys schemed to sell her to a stranger a barbarian when she was clean the slaves helped her from the water and toweled her dry the girl brushed her hair until it shone like molten silver while the old woman anointed her with the spiceflower perfume of the dothraki plains a dab on each wrist behind her ears on the tips of her breasts and one last one cool on her lips down there between her legs they dressed her in the wisps that magister illyrio had sent up and then the gown a deep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes the girl slid the gilded sandals onto her feet while the old woman fixed the tiara in her hair and slid golden bracelets crusted with amethysts around her wrists last of all came the collar a heavy golden tore emblazoned with ancient valyrian glyphs now you look all a princess the girl said breathlessly when they were done dany glanced at her image in the silvered looking glass that illyrio had so thoughtfully provided a princess she thought but she remembered what the girl had said how khal drogo was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars she felt a sudden chill and gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms her brother was waiting in the cool of the entry hall seated on the edge of the pool his hand trailing in the water he rose when she appeared and looked her over critically stand there he told her turn around yes good you look regal magister illyrio said stepping through an archway he moved with surprising delicacy for such a massive man beneath loose garments of flame colored silk rolls of fat jiggled as he walked gemstones glittered on every finger and his man had oiled his forked yellow beard until it shone like real gold may the lord of light shower you with blessings on this most fortunate day princess daenerys the magister said as he took her hand he bowed his head showing a thin glimpse of crooked yellow teeth through the gold of his beard she is a vision your grace a vision he told her brother drogo will be enraptured shes too skinny viserys said his hair the same silver blond as hers had been pulled back tightly behind his head and fastened with a dragonbone brooch it was a severe look that emphasized the hard gaunt lines of his face he rested his hand on the hilt of the sword that illyrio had lent him and said are you sure that khal drogo likes his women this young she has had her blood she is old enough for the khal illyrio told him not for the first time look at her that silvergold hair those purple eyes she is the blood of old valyria no doubt no doubt and highborn daughter of the old king sister to the new she cannot fail to entrance our drogo when he released her hand daenerys found herself trembling i suppose her brother said doubtfully the savages have queer tastes boys horses sheep best not suggest this to khal drogo illyrio said anger flashed in her brothers lilac eyes do you take me for a fool the magister bowed slightly i take you for a king kings lack the caution of common men my apologies if i have given offense he turned away and clapped his hands for his bearers the streets of pentos were pitch dark when they set out in illyrios elaborately carved palanquin two servants went ahead to light their way carrying ornate oil lanterns with panes of pale blue glass while a dozen strong men hoisted the poles to their shoulders it was warm and close inside behind the curtains dany could smell the stench of illyrios pallid flesh through his heavy perfumes her brother sprawled out on his pillows beside her never noticed his mind was away across the narrow sea we wont need his whole khalasar viserys said his fingers toyed with the hilt of his borrowed blade though dany knew he had never used a sword in earnest ten thousand that would be enough i could sweep the seven kingdoms with ten thousand dothraki screamers the realm will rise for its rightful king tyrell redwyne darry greyjoy they have no more love for the usurper than i do the dornishmen burn to avenge elia and her children and the smallfolk will be with us they cry out for their king he looked at illyrio anxiously they do dont they they are your people and they love you well magister illyrio said amiably in holdfasts all across the realm men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the day of your return from across the water he gave a massive shrug or so my agents tell me dany had no agents no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea but she mistrusted illyrios sweet words as she mistrusted everything about illyrio her brother was nodding eagerly however i shall kill the usurper myself he promised who had never killed anyone as he killed my brother rhaegar and lannister too the kingslayer for what he did to my father that would be most fitting magister illyrio said dany saw the smallest hint of a smile playing around his full lips but her brother did not notice nodding he pushed back a curtain and stared off into the night and dany knew he was fighting the battle of the trident once again the nine towered manse of khal drogo sat beside the waters of the bay its high brick walls overgrown with pale ivy it had been given to the khal by the magisters of pentos illyrio told them the free cities were always generous with the horselords it is not that we fear these barbarians illyrio would explain with a smile the lord of light would hold our city walls against a million dothraki or so the red priests promise yet why take chances when their friendship comes so cheap their palanquin was stopped at the gate the curtains pulled roughly back by one of the house guards he had the copper skin and dark almond eyes of a dothraki but his face was hairless and he wore the spiked bronze cap of the unsullied he looked them over coldly magister illyrio growled something to him in the rough dothraki tongue the guardsman replied in the same voice and waved them through the gates dany noticed that her brothers hand was clenched tightly around the hilt of his borrowed sword he looked almost as frightened as she felt insolent eunuch viserys muttered as the palanquin lurched up toward the manse magister illyrios words were honey many important men will be at the feast tonight such men have enemies the khal must protect his guests yourself chief among them your grace no doubt the usurper would pay well for your head oh yes viserys said darkly he has tried illyrio i promise you that his hired knives follow us everywhere i am the last dragon and he will not sleep easy while i live the palanquin slowed and stopped the curtains were thrown back and a slave offered a hand to help daenerys out his collar she noted was ordinary bronze her brother followed one hand still clenched hard around his sword hilt it took two strong men to get magister illyrio back on his feet inside the manse the air was heavy with the scent of spices pinchfire and sweet lemon and cinnamon they were escorted across the entry hall where a mosaic of colored glass depicted the doom of valyria oil burned in black iron lanterns all along the walls beneath an arch of twining stone leaves a eunuch sang their coming viserys of the house targaryen the third of his name he called in a high sweet voice king of the andals and the rhoynar and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm his sister daenerys stormborn princess of dragonstone his honorable host illyrio mopatis magister of the free city of pentos they stepped past the eunuch into a pillared courtyard overgrown in pale ivy moonlight painted the leaves in shades of bone and silver as the guests drifted among them many were dothraki horselords big men with red brown skin their drooping mustachios bound in metal rings their black hair oiled and braided and hung with bells yet among them moved bravos and sellswords from pentos and myr and tyrosh a red priest even fatter than illyrio hairy men from the port of ibben and lords from the summer isles with skin as black as ebony daenerys looked at them all in wonder and realized with a sudden start of fear that she was the only woman there illyrio whispered to them those three are drogos bloodriders there he said by the pillar is khal moro with his son rhogoro the man with the green beard is brother to the archon of tyrosh and the man behind him is ser jorah mormont the last name caught daenerys a knight no less illyrio smiled through his beard anointed with the seven oils by the high septon himself what is he doing here she blurted the usurper wanted his head illyrio told them some trifling affront he sold some poachers to a tyroshi slaver instead of giving them to the nights watch absurd law a man should be able to do as he likes with his own chattel i shall wish to speak with ser jorah before the night is done her brother said dany found herself looking at the knight curiously he was an older man past forty and balding but still strong and fit instead of silks and cottons he wore wool and leather his tunic was a dark green embroidered with the likeness of a black bear standing on two legs she was still looking at this strange man from the homeland she had never known when magister illyrio placed a moist hand on her bare shoulder over there sweet princess he whispered there is the khal himself dany wanted to run and hide but her brother was looking at her and if she displeased him she knew she would wake the dragon anxiously she turned and looked at the man viserys hoped would ask to wed her before the night was done the slave girl had not been far wrong she thought khal drogo was a head taller than the tallest man in the room yet somehow light on his feet as graceful as the panther in illyrios menagerie he was younger than shed thought no more than thirty his skin was the color of polished copper his thick mustachios bound with gold and bronze rings i must go and make my submissions magister illyrio said wait here i shall bring him to you her brother took her by the arm as illyrio waddled over to the khal his fingers squeezing so hard that they hurt do you see his braid sweet sister drogos braid was black as midnight and heavy with scented oil hung with tiny bells that rang softly as he moved it swung well past his belt below even his buttocks the end of it brushing against the back of his thighs you see how long it is viserys said when dothraki are defeated in combat they cut off their braids in disgrace so the world will know their shame khal drogo has never lost a fight he is aegon the dragonlord come again and you will be his queen dany looked at khal drogo his face was hard and cruel his eyes as cold and dark as onyx her brother hurt her sometimes when she woke the dragon but he did not frighten her the way this man frightened her i dont want to be his queen she heard herself say in a small thin voice please please viserys i dont want to i want to go home home he kept his voice low but she could hear the fury in his tone how are we to go home sweet sister they took our home from us he drew her into the shadows out of sight his fingers digging into her skin how are we to go home he repeated meaning kings landing and dragonstone and all the realm they had lost dany had only meant their rooms in illyrios estate no true home surely though all they had but her brother did not want to hear that there was no home there for him even the big house with the red door had not been home for him his fingers dug hard into her arm demanding an answer i dont know she said at last her voice breaking tears welled in her eyes i do he said sharply we go home with an army sweet sister with khal drogos army that is how we go home and if you must wed him and bed him for that you will he smiled at her id let his whole khalasar fuck you if need be sweet sister all forty thousand men and their horses too if that was what it took to get my army be grateful it is only drogo in time you may even learn to like him now dry your eyes illyrio is bringing him over and he will not see you crying dany turned and saw that it was true magister illyrio all smiles and bows was escorting khal drogo over to where they stood she brushed away unfallen tears with the back of her hand smile viserys whispered nervously his hand failing to the hilt of his sword and stand up straight let him see that you have breasts gods know you have little enough as is daenerys smiled and stood up straight eddard the visitors poured through the castle gates in a river of gold and silver and polished steel three hundred strong a pride of bannermen and knights of sworn swords and freeriders over their heads a dozen golden banners whipped back and forth in the northern wind emblazoned with the crowned stag of baratheon ned knew many of the riders there came ser jaime lannister with hair as bright as beaten gold and there sandor clegane with his terrible burned face the tall boy beside him could only be the crown prince and that stunted little man behind them was surely the imp tyrion lannister yet the huge man at the head of the column flanked by two knights in the snow white cloaks of the kingsguard seemed almost a stranger to ned until he vaulted off the back of his warhorse with a familiar roar and crushed him in a bone crunching hug ned ah but it is good to see that frozen face of yours the king looked him over top to bottom and laughed you have not changed at all would that ned had been able to say the same fifteen years past when they had ridden forth to win a throne the lord of storms end had been clean shaven clear eyed and muscled like a maidens fantasy six and a half feet tall he towered over lesser men and when he donned his armor and the great antlered helmet of his house he became a veritable giant hed had a giants strength too his weapon of choice a spiked iron warhammer that ned could scarcely lift in those days the smell of leather and blood had clung to him like perfume now it was perfume that clung to him like perfume and he had a girth to match his height ned had last seen the king nine years before during balon greyjoys rebellion when the stag and the direwolf had joined to end the pretensions of the self proclaimed king of the iron islands since the night they had stood side by side in greyjoys fallen stronghold where robert had accepted the rebel lords surrender and ned had taken his son theon as hostage and ward the king had gained at least eight stone a beard as coarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the royal jowls but nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes yet robert was neds king now and not just a friend so he said only your grace winterfell is yours by then the others were dismounting as well and grooms were coming forward for their mounts roberts queen cersei lannister entered on foot with her younger children the wheelhouse in which they had ridden a huge double decked carriage of oiled oak and gilded metal pulled by forty heavy draft horses was too wide to pass through the castle gate ned knelt in the snow to kiss the queens ring while robert embraced catelyn like a long lost sister then the children had been brought forward introduced and approved of by both sides no sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to his host take me down to your crypt eddard i would pay my respects ned loved him for that for remembering her still after all these years he called for a lantern no other words were needed the queen had begun to protest they had been riding since dawn everyone was tired and cold surely they should refresh themselves first the dead would wait she had said no more than that robert had looked at her and her twin brother jaime had taken her quietly by the arm and she had said no more they went down to the crypt together ned and this king he scarcely recognized the winding stone steps were narrow ned went first with the lantern i was starting to think we would never reach winterfell robert complained as they descended in the south the way they talk about my seven kingdoms a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined i trust you enjoyed the journey your grace robert snorted bogs and forests and fields and scarcely a decent inn north of the neck ive never seen such a vast emptiness where are all yourpeople likely they were too shy to come out ned jested he could feel the chill coming up the stairs a cold breath from deep within the earth kings are a rare sight in the north robert snorted more likely they were hiding under the snow snow ned the king put one hand on the wall to steady himself as they descended late summer snows are common enough ned said i hope they did not trouble you they are usually mild the others take your mild snows robert swore what will this place be like in winter i shudder to think the winters are hard ned admitted but the starks will endure we always have you need to come south robert told him you need a taste of summer before it flees in highgarden there are fields of golden roses that stretch away as far as the eye can see the fruits are so ripe they explode in your mouth melons peaches fireplums youve never tasted such sweetness youll see i brought you some even at storms end with that good wind off the bay the days are so hot you can barely move and you ought to see the towns ned flowers everywhere the markets bursting with food the surnmerwines so cheap and so good that you can get drunk just breathing the air everyone is fat and drunk and rich he laughed and slapped his own ample stomach a thump and the girls ned he exclaimed his eyes sparkling i swear women lose all modesty in the heat they swim naked in the river right beneath the castle even in the streets its too damn hot for wool or fur so they go around in these short gowns silk if they have the silver and cotton if not but its all the same when they start sweating and the cloth sticks to their skin they might as well be naked the king laughed happily robert baratheon had always been a man of huge appetites a man who knew how to take his pleasures that was not a charge anyone could lay at the door of eddard stark yet ned could not help but notice that those pleasures were taking a toll on the king robert was breathing heavily by the time they reached the bottom of the stairs his face red in the lantern light as they stepped out into the darkness of the crypt your grace ned said respectfully he swept the lantern in a wide semicircle shadows moved and lurched flickering light touched the stones underfoot and brushed against a long procession of granite pillars that marched ahead two by two into the dark between the pillars the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls backs against the sepulchres that contained their mortal remains she is down at the end with father and brandon he led the way between the pillars and robert followed wordlessly shivering in the subterranean chill it was always cold down here their footsteps rang off the stones and echoed in the vault overhead as they walked among the dead of house stark the lords of winterfell watched them pass their likenesses were carved into the stones that sealed the tombs in long rows they sat blind eyes staring out into eternal darkness while great stone direwolves curled round their feet the shifting shadows made the stone figures seem to stir as the living passed by by ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been lord of winterfell to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts the oldest had long ago rusted away to nothing leaving only a few red stains where the metal had rested on stone ned wondered if that meant those ghosts were free to roam the castle now he hoped not the first lords of winterfell had been men hard as the land they ruled in the centuries before the dragonlords came over the sea they had sworn allegiance to no man styling themselves the kings in the north ned stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern the crypt continued on into darkness ahead of them but beyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed black holes waiting for their dead waiting for him and his children ned did not like to think on that here he told his king robert nodded silently knelt and bowed his head there were three tombs side by side lord rickard stark neds father had a long stern face the stonemason had known him well he sat with quiet dignity stone fingers holding tight to the sword across his lap but in life all swords had failed him in two smaller sepulchres on either side were his children brandon had been twenty when he died strangled by order of the mad king aerys targaryen only a few short days before he was to wed catelyn tully of riverrun his father had been forced to watch him die he was the true heir the eldest born to rule lyanna had only been sixteen a child woman of surpassing loveliness ned had loved her with all his heart robert had loved her even more she was to have been his bride she was more beautiful than that the king said after a silence his eyes lingered on lyannas face as if he could will her back to life finally he rose made awkward by his weight ah damn it ned did you have to bury her in a place like this his voice was hoarse with remembered grief she deserved more than darkness she was a stark of winterfell ned said quietly this is her place she should be on a hill somewhere under a fruit tree with the sun and clouds above her and the rain to wash her clean i was with her when she died ned reminded the king she wanted to come home to rest beside brandon and father he could hear her still at times promise me she had cried in a room that smelled of blood and roses promise me ned the fever had taken her strength and her voice had been faint as a whisper but when he gave her his word the fear had gone out of his sisters eyes ned remembered the way she had smiled then how tightly her fingers had clutched his as she gave up her hold on life the rose petals spilling from her palm dead and black after that he remembered nothing they had found him still holding her body silent with grief the little crannogman howland reed had taken her hand from his ned could recall none of it i bring her flowers when i can he said lyanna was fond of flowers the king touched her cheek his fingers brushing across the rough stone as gently as if it were living flesh i vowed to kill rhaegar for what he did to her you did ned reminded him only once robert said bitterly they had come together at the ford of the trident while the battle crashed around them robert with his warhammer and his great antlered helm the targaryen prince armored all in black on his breastplate was the three headed dragon of his house wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the sunlight the waters of the trident ran red around the hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed again and again until at last a crushing blow from roberts hammer stove in the dragon and the chest beneath it when ned had finally come on the scene rhaegar lay dead in the stream while men of both armies scrabbled in the swirling waters for rubies knocked free of his armor in my dreams i kill him every night robert admitted a thousand deaths will still be less than he deserves there was nothing ned could say to that after a quiet he said we should return your grace your wife will be waiting the others take my wife robert muttered sourly but he started back the way they had come his footsteps falling heavily and if i hear your grace once more ill have your head on a spike we are more to each other than that i had not forgotten ned replied quietly when the king did not answer he said tell me about jon robert shook his head i have never seen a man sicken so quickly we gave a tourney on my sons name day if you had seen jon then you would have sworn he would live forever a fortnight later he was dead the sickness was like a fire in his gut it burned right through him he paused beside a pillar before the tomb of a long dead stark i loved that old man we both did ned paused a moment catelyn fears for her sister how does lysa bear her grief roberts mouth gave a bitter twist not well in truth he admitted i think losing jon has driven the woman mad ned she has taken the boy back to the eyrie against my wishes i had hoped to foster him with tywin lannister at casterly rock jon had no brothers no other sons was i supposed to leave him to be raised by women ned would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than to lord tywin but he left his doubts unspoken some old wounds never truly heal and bleed again at the slightest word the wife has lost the husband he said carefully perhaps the mother feared to lose the son the boy is very young six and sickly and lord of the eyrie gods have mercy the king swore lord tywin had never taken a ward before lysa ought to have been honored the lannisters are a great and noble house she refused to even hear of it then she left in the dead of night without so much as a by your leave cersei was furious he sighed deeply the boy is my namesake did you know that robert arryn i am sworn to protect him how can i do that if his mother steals him away i will take him as ward if you wish ned said lysa should consent to that she and catelyn were close as girls and she would be welcome here as well a generous offer my friend the king said but too late lord tywin has already given his consent fostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him i have more concern for my nephews welfare than i do for lannister pride ned declared that is because you do not sleep with a lannister robert laughed the sound rattling among the tombs and bouncing from the vaulted ceiling his smile was a flash of white teeth in the thicket of the huge black beard ah ned he said you are still too serious he put a massive arm around neds shoulders i had planned to wait a few days to speak to you but i see now theres no need for it come walk with me they started back down between the pillars blind stone eyes seemed to follow them as they passed the king kept his arm around neds shoulder you must have wondered why i finally came north to winterfell after so long ned had his suspicions but he did not give them voice for the joy of my company surely he said lightly and there is the wall you need to see it your grace to walk along its battlements and talk to those who man it the nights watch is a shadow of what it once was benjen says no doubt i will hear what your brother says soon enough robert said the wall has stood for what eight thousand years it can keep a few days more i have more pressing concerns these are difficult times i need good men about me men like jon arryn he served as lord of the eyrie as warden of the east as the hand of the king he will not be easy to replace his son ned began his son will succeed to the eyrie and all its incomes robert said brusquely no more that took ned by surprise he stopped startled and turned to look at his king the words came unbidden the arryns have always been wardens of the east the title goes with the domain perhaps when he comes of age the honor can be restored to him robert said i have this year to think of and next a six year old boy is no war leader ned in peace the title is only an honor let the boy keep it for his fathers sake if not his own surely you owe jon that much for his service the king was not pleased he took his arm from around neds shoulders jons service was the duty he owed his liege lord i am not ungrateful ned you of all men ought to know that but the son is not the father a mere boy cannot hold the east then his tone softened enough of this there is a more important office to discuss and i would not argue with you robert grasped ned by the elbow i have need of you ned i am yours to command your grace always they were words he had to say and so he said them apprehensive about what might come next robert scarcely seemed to hear him those years we spent in the eyrie gods those were good years i want you at my side again ned i want you down in kings landing not up here at the end of the world where you are no damned use to anybody robert looked off into the darkness for a moment as melancholy as a stark i swear to you sitting a throne is a thousand times harder than winning one laws are a tedious business and counting coppers is worse and the people there is no end of them i sit on that damnable iron chair and listen to them complain until my mind is numb and my ass is raw they all want something money or land or justice the lies they tell and my lords and ladies are no better i am surrounded by flatterers and fools it can drive a man to madness ned half of them dont dare tell me the truth and the other half cant find it there are nights i wish we had lost at the trident ah no not truly but i understand ned said softly robert looked at him i think you do if so you are the only one my old friend he smiled lord eddard stark i would name you the hand of the king ned dropped to one knee the offer did not surprise him what other reason could robert have had for coming so far the hand of the king was the second most powerful man in the seven kingdoms he spoke with the kings voice commanded the kings armies drafted the kings laws at times he even sat upon the iron throne to dispense kings justice when the king was absent or sick or otherwise indisposed robert was offering him a responsibility as large as the realm itself it was the last thing in the world he wanted your grace he said i am not worthy of the honor robert groaned with good humored impatience if i wanted to honor you id let you retire i am planning to make you run the kingdom and fight the wars while i eat and drink and wench myself into an early grave he slapped his gut and grinned you know the saying about the king and his hand ned knew the saying what the king dreams he said the hand builds i bedded a fishmaid once who told me the lowborn have a choicer way to put it the king eats they say and the hand takes the shit he threw back his head and roared his laughter the echoes rang through the darkness and all around them the dead of winterfell seemed to watch with cold and disapproving eyes finally the laughter dwindled and stopped ned was still on one knee his eyes upraised damn it ned the king complained you might at least humor me with a smile they say it grows so cold up here in winter that a mans laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to death ned said evenly perhaps that is why the starks have so little humor come south with me and ill teach you how to laugh again the king promised you helped me win this damnable throne now help me hold it we were meant to rule together if lyanna had lived we should have been brothers bound by blood as well as affection well it is not too late i have a son you have a daughter my joff and your sansa shall join our houses as lyanna and i might once have done this offer did surprise him sansa is only eleven robert waved an impatient hand old enough for betrothal the marriage can wait a few years the king smiled now stand up and say yes curse you nothing would give me greater pleasure your grace ned answered he hesitated these honors are all so unexpected may i have some time to consider i need to tell my wife yes yes of course tell catelyn sleep on it if you must the king reached down clasped ned by the hand and pulled him roughly to his feet just dont keep me waiting too long i am not the most patient of men for a moment eddard stark was filled with a terrible sense of foreboding this was his place here in the north he looked at the stone figures all around them breathed deep in the chill silence of the crypt he could feel the eyes of the dead they were all listening he knew and winter was coming jon there were times not many but a few when jon snow was glad he was a bastard as he filled his wine cup once more from a passing flagon it struck him that this might be one of them he settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank the sweet fruity taste of surnmerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips the great hall of winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell of roasted meat and fresh baked bread its grey stone walls were draped with banners white gold crimson the direwolf of stark baratheons crowned stag the lion of lannister a singer was playing the high harp and reciting a ballad but down at this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire the clangor of pewter plates and cups and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations it was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king jons brothers and sisters had been seated with the royal children beneath the raised platform where lord and lady stark hosted the king and queen in honor of the occasion his lord father would doubtless permit each child a glass of wine but no more than that down here on the benches there was no one to stop jon drinking as much as he had a thirst for and he was finding that he had a mans thirst to the raucous delight of the youths around him who urged him on every time he drained a glass they were fine company and jon relished the stories they were telling tales of battle and bedding and the hunt he was certain that his companions were more entertaining than the kings offspring he had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their entrance the procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on the bench and jon had gotten a good long look at them all his lord father had come first escorting the queen she was as beautiful as men said a jeweled tiara gleamed amidst her long golden hair its emeralds a perfect match for the green of her eyes his father helped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat but the queen never so much as looked at him even at fourteen jon could see through her smile next had come king robert himself with lady stark on his arm the king was a great disappointment to jon his father had talked of him often the peerless robert baratheon demon of the trident the fiercest warrior of the realm a giant among princes jon saw only a fat man red faced under his beard sweating through his silks he walked like a man half in his cups after them came the children little rickon first managing the long walk with all the dignity a three year old could muster jon had to urge him on when he stopped to visit close behind came robb in grey wool trimmed with white the stark colors he had the princess myrcella on his arm she was a wisp of a girl not quite eight her hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net jon noticed the shy looks she gave robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him he decided she was insipid robb didnt even have the sense to realize how stupid she was he was grinning like a fool his half sisters escorted the royal princes arya was paired with plump young tommen whose white blond hair was longer than hers sansa two years older drew the crown prince joffrey baratheon he was twelve younger than jon or robb but taller than either to jons vast dismay prince joffrey had his sisters hair and his mothers deep green eyes a thick tangle of blond curls dripped down past his golden choker and high velvet collar sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him but jon did not like joffreys pouty lips or the bored disdainful way he looked at winterfells great hall he was more interested in the pair that came behind him the queens brothers the lannisters of casterly rock the lion and the imp there was no mistaking which was which ser jaime lannister was twin to queen cersei tall and golden with flashing green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife he wore crimson silk high black boots a black satin cloak on the breast of his tunic the lion of his house was embroidered in gold thread roaring its defiance they called him the lion of lannister to his face and whispered kingslayer behind his back jon found it hard to look away from him this is what a king should look like he thought to himself as the man passed then he saw the other one waddling along half hidden by his brothers side tyrion lannister the youngest of lord tywins brood and by far the ugliest all that the gods had given to cersei and jaime they had denied tyrion he was a dwarf half his brothers height struggling to keep pace on stunted legs his head was too large for his body with a brutes squashed in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow one green eye and one black one peered out from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed white jon watched him with fascination the last of the high lords to enter were his uncle benjen stark of the nights watch and his fathers ward young theon greyjoy benjen gave jon a warm smile as he went by theon ignored him utterly but there was nothing new in that after all had been seated toasts were made thanks were given and returned and then the feasting began jon had started drinking then and he had not stopped something rubbed against his leg beneath the table jon saw red eyes staring up at him hungry again he asked there was still half a honeyed chicken in the center of the table jon reached out to tear off a leg then had a better idea he knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between his legs ghost ripped into it in savage silence his brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their wolves to the banquet but there were more curs than jon could count at this end of the hall and no one had said a word about his pup he told himself he was fortunate in that too his eyes stung jon rubbed at them savagely cursing the smoke he swallowed another gulp of wine and watched his direwolf devour the chicken dogs moved between the tables trailing after the serving girls one of them a black mongrel bitch with long yellow eyes caught a scent of the chicken she stopped and edged under the bench to get a share jon watched the confrontation the bitch growled low in her throat and moved closer ghost looked up silent and fixed the dog with those hot red eyes the bitch snapped an angry challenge she was three times the size of the direwolf pup ghost did not move he stood over his prize and opened his mouth baring his fangs the bitch tensed barked again then thought better of this fight she turned and slunk away with one last defiant snap to save her pride ghost went back to his meal jon grinned and reached under the table to ruffle the shaggy white fur the direwolf looked up at him nipped gently at his hand then went back to eating is this one of the direwolves ive heard so much of a familiar voice asked close at hand jon looked up happily as his uncle ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his hair much as jon had ruffled the wolf s yes he said his name is ghost one of the squires interrupted the bawdy story hed been telling to make room at the table for their lords brother benjen stark straddled the bench with long legs and took the wine cup out of jons hand summerwine he said after a taste nothing so sweet how many cups have you had jon jon smiled ben stark laughed as i feared ah well i believe i was younger than you the first time i got truly and sincerely drunk he snagged a roasted onion dripping brown with gravy from a nearby trencher and bit into it it crunched his uncle was sharp featured and gaunt as a mountain crag but there was always a hint of laughter in his blue grey eyes he dressed in black as befitted a man of the nights watch tonight it was rich black velvet with high leather boots and a wide belt with a silver buckle a heavy silver chain was looped round his neck benjen watched ghost with amusement as he ate his onion a very quiet wolf he observed hes not like the others jon said he never makes a sound thats why i named him ghost that and because hes white the others are all dark grey or black there are still direwolves beyond the wall we hear them on our rangings benjen stark gave jon a long look dont you usually eat at table with your brothers most times jon answered in a flat voice but tonight lady stark thought it might give insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among them i see his uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall my brother does not seem very festive tonight jon had noticed that too a bastard had to learn to notice things to read the truth that people hid behind their eyes his father was observing all the courtesies but there was tightness in him that jon had seldom seen before he said little looking out over the hall with hooded eyes seeing nothing two seats away the king had been drinking heavily all night his broad face was flushed behind his great black beard he made many a toast laughed loudly at every jest and attacked each dish like a starving man but beside him the queen seemed as cold as an ice sculpture the queen is angry too jon told his uncle in a low quiet voice father took the king down to the crypts this afternoon the queen didnt want him to go benjen gave jon a careful measuring look you dont miss much do you jon we could use a man like you on the wall jon swelled with pride robb is a stronger lance than i am but im the better sword and hullen says i sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle notable achievements take me with you when you go back to the wall jon said in a sudden rush father will give me leave to go if you ask him i know he will uncle benjen studied his face carefully the wall is a hard place for a boy jon i am almost a man grown jon protested i will turn fifteen on my next name day and maester luwin says bastards grow up faster than other children thats true enough benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth he took jons cup from the table filled it fresh from a nearby pitcher and drank down a long swallow daeren targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered dorne jon said the young dragon was one of his heroes a conquest that lasted a summer his uncle pointed out your boy king lost ten thousand men taking the place and another fifty trying to hold it someone should have told him that war isnt a game he took another sip of wine also he said wiping his mouth daeren targaryen was only eighteen when he died or have you forgotten that part i forget nothing jon boasted the wine was making him bold he tried to sit very straight to make himself seem taller i want to serve in the nights watch uncle he had thought on it long and hard lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him robb would someday inherit winterfell would command great armies as the warden of the north bran and rickon would be robbs bannermen and rule holdfasts in his name his sisters arya and sansa would marry the heirs of other great houses and go south as mistress of castles of their own but what place could a bastard hope to earn you dont know what youre asking jon the nights watch is a sworn brotherhood we have no families none of us will ever father sons our wife is duty our mistress is honor a bastard can have honor too jon said i am ready to swear your oath you are a boy of fourteen benjen said not a man not yet until you have known a woman you cannot understand what you would be giving up i dont care about that jon said hotly you might if you knew what it meant benjen said if you knew what the oath would cost you you might be less eager to pay the price son jon felt anger rise inside him im not your son benjen stark stood up mores the pity he put a hand on jons shoulder come back to me after youve fathered a few bastards of your own and well see how you feel jon trembled i will never father a bastard he said carefully never he spat it out like venom suddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent and they were all looking at him he felt the tears begin to well behind his eyes he pushed himself to his feet i must be excused he said with the last of his dignity he whirled and bolted before they could see him cry he must have drunk more wine than he had realized his feet got tangled under him as he tried to leave and he lurched sideways into a serving girl and sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor laughter boomed all around him and jon felt hot tears on his cheeks someone tried to steady him he wrenched free of their grip and ran half blind for the door ghost followed close at his heels out into the night the yard was quiet and empty a lone sentry stood high on the battlements of the inner wall his cloak pulled tight around him against the cold he looked bored and miserable as he huddled there alone but jon would have traded places with him in an instant otherwise the castle was dark and deserted jon had seen an abandoned holdfast once a drear place where nothing moved but the wind and the stones kept silent about whatever people had lived there winterfell reminded him of that tonight the sounds of music and song spilled through the open windows behind him they were the last things jon wanted to hear he wiped away his tears on the sleeve of his shirt furious that he had let them fall and turned to go boy a voice called out to him jon turned tyrion lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the great hall looking for all the world like a gargoyle the dwarf grinned down at him is that animal a wolf a direwolf jon said his name is ghost he stared up at the little man his disappointment suddenly forgotten what are you doing up there why arent you at the feast too hot too noisy and id drunk too much wine the dwarf told him i learned long ago that it is considered rude to vomit on your brother might i have a closer look at your wolf jon hesitated then nodded slowly can you climb down or shall i bring a ladder oh bleed that the little man said he pushed himself off the ledge into empty air jon gasped then watched with awe as tyrion lannister spun around in a tight ball landed lightly on his hands then vaulted backward onto his legs ghost backed away from him uncertainly the dwarf dusted himself off and laughed i believe ive frightened your wolf my apologies hes not scared jon said he knelt and called out ghost come here come on thats it the wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at jons face but he kept a wary eye on tyrion lannister and when the dwarf reached out to pet him he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl shy isnt he lannister observed sit ghost jon commanded thats it keep still he looked up at the dwarf you can touch him now he wont move until i tell him to ive been training him i see lannister said he ruffled the snow white fur between ghosts ears and said nice wolf if i wasnt here hed tear out your throat jon said it wasnt actually true yet but it would be in that case you had best stay close the dwarf said he cocked his oversized head to one side and looked jon over with his mismatched eyes i am tyrion lannister i know jon said he rose standing he was taller than the dwarf it made him feel strange youre ned starks bastard arent you jon felt a coldness pass right through him he pressed his lips together and said nothing did i offend you lannister said sorry dwarfs dont have to be tactful generations of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head he grinned you are the bastard though lord eddard stark is my father jon admitted stiffly lannister studied his face yes he said i can see it you have more of the north in you than your brothers half brothers jon corrected he was pleased by the dwarf s comment but he tried not to let it show let me give you some counsel bastard lannister said never forget what you are for surely the world will not make it your strength then it can never be your weakness armor yourself in it and it will never be used to hurt you jon was in no mood for anyones counsel what do you know about being a bastard all dwarfs are bastards in their fathers eyes you are your mothers trueborn son of lannister am i the dwarf replied sardonic do tell my lord father my mother died birthing me and hes never been sure i dont even know who my mother was jon said some woman no doubt most of them are he favored jon with a rueful grin remember this boy all dwarfs may be bastards yet not all bastards need be dwarfs and with that he turned and sauntered back into the feast whistling a tune when he opened the door the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard and for just a moment tyrion lannister stood tall as a king catelyn f all the rooms in winterfells great keep catelyns bedchambers were the hottest she seldom had to light a fire the castle had been built over natural hot springs and the scalding waters rushed through its walls and chambers like blood through a mans body driving the chill from the stone halls filling the glass gardens with a moist warmth keeping the earth from freezing open pools smoked day and night in a dozen small courtyards that was a little thing in summer in winter it was the difference between life and death catelyns bath was always hot and steaming and her walls warm to the touch the warmth reminded her of riverrun of days in the sun with lysa and edmure but ned could never abide the heat the starks were made for the cold he would tell her and she would laugh and tell him in that case they had certainly built their castle in the wrong place so when they had finished ned rolled off and climbed from her bed as he had a thousand times before he crossed the room pulled back the heavy tapestries and threw open the high narrow windows one by one letting the night air into the chamber the wind swirled around him as he stood facing the dark naked and empty handed catelyn pulled the furs to her chin and watched him he looked somehow smaller and more vulnerable like the youth she had wed in the sept at riverrun fifteen long years gone her loins still ached from the urgency of his lovernaking it was a good ache she could feel his seed within her she prayed that it might quicken there it had been three years since rickon she was not too old she could give him another son i will refuse him ned said as he turned back to her his eyes were haunted his voice thick with doubt catelyn sat up in the bed you cannot you must not my duties are here in the north i have no wish to be roberts hand he will not understand that he is a king now and kings are not like other men if you refuse to serve him he will wonder why and sooner or later he will begin to suspect that you oppose him cant you see the danger that would put us in ned shook his head refusing to believe robert would never harm me or any of mine we were closer than brothers he loves me if i refuse him he will roar and curse and bluster and in a week we will laugh about it together i know the man you knew the man she said the king is a stranger to you catelyn remembered the direwolf dead in the snow the broken antler lodged deep in her throat she had to make him see pride is everything to a king my lord robert came all this way to see you to bring you these great honors you cannot throw them back in his face honors ned laughed bitterly in his eyes yes she said and in yours and in mine she blazed angry now why couldnt he see he offers his own son in marriage to our daughter what else would you call that sansa might someday be queen her sons could rule from the wall to the mountains of dorne what is so wrong with that gods catelyn sansa is only eleven ned said and joffrey joffrey is she finished for him crown prince and heir to the iron throne and i was only twelve when my father promised me to your brother brandon that brought a bitter twist to neds mouth brandon yes brandon would know what to do he always did it was all meant for brandon you winterfell everything he was born to be a kings hand and a father to queens i never asked for this cup to pass to me perhaps not catelyn said but brandon is dead and the cup has passed and you must drink from it like it or not ned turned away from her back to the night he stood staring out in the darkness watching the moon and the stars perhaps or perhaps the sentries on the wall catelyn softened then to see his pain eddard stark had married her in brandons place as custom decreed but the shadow of his dead brother still lay between them as did the other the shadow of the woman he would not name the woman who had borne him his bastard son she was about to go to him when the knock came at the door loud and unexpected ned turned frowning what is it desmonds voice came through the door my lord maester luwin is without and begs urgent audience you told him i had left orders not to be disturbed yes my lord he insists very well send him in ned crossed to the wardrobe and slipped on a heavy robe catelyn realized suddenly how cold it had become she sat up in bed and pulled the furs to her chin perhaps we should close the windows she suggested ned nodded absently maester luwin was shown in the maester was a small grey man his eyes were grey and quick and saw much his hair was grey what little the years had left him his robe was grey wool trimmed with white fur the stark colors its great floppy sleeves had pockets hidden inside luwin was always tucking things into those sleeves and producing other things from them books messages strange artifacts toys for the children with all he kept hidden in his sleeves catelyn was surprised that maester luwin could lift his arms at all the maester waited until the door had closed behind him before he spoke my lord he said to ned pardon for disturbing your rest i have been left a message ned looked irritated been left by whom has there been a rider i was not told there was no rider my lord only a carved wooden box left on a table in my observatory while i napped my servants saw no one but it must have been brought by someone in the kings party we have had no other visitors from the south a wooden box you say catelyn said inside was a fine new lens for the observatory from myr by the look of it the lenscrafters of myr are without equal ned frowned he had little patience for this sort of thing catelyn knew a lens he said what has that to do with me i asked the same question maester luwin said clearly there was more to this than the seeming under the heavy weight of her furs catelyn shivered a lens is an instrument to help us see indeed it is he fingered the collar of his order a heavy chain worn tight around the neck beneath his robe each link forged from a different metal catelyn could feel dread stirring inside her once again what is it that they would have us see more clearly the very thing i asked myself maester luwin drew a tightly rolled paper out of his sleeve i found the true message concealed within a false bottom when i dismantled the box the lens had come in but it is not for my eyes ned held out his hand let me have it then luwin did not stir pardons my lord the message is not for you either it is marked for the eyes of the lady catelyn and her alone may i approach catelyn nodded not trusting to speak the maester placed the paper on the table beside the bed it was sealed with a small blob of blue wax luwin bowed and began to retreat stay ned commanded him his voice was grave he looked at catelyn what is it my lady youre shaking im afraid she admitted she reached out and took the letter in trembling hands the furs dropped away from her nakedness forgotten in the blue wax was the moon and falcon seal of house arryn its from lysa catelyn looked at her husband it will not make us glad she told him there is grief in this message ned i can feel it ned frowned his face darkening open it catelyn broke the seal her eyes moved over the words at first they made no sense to her then she remembered lysa took no chances when we were girls together we had a private language she and l can you read it yes catelyn admitted then tell us perhaps i should withdraw maester luwin said no catelyn said we will need your counsel she threw back the furs and climbed from the bed the night air was as cold as the grave on her bare skin as she padded across the room maester luwin averted his eyes even ned looked shocked what are you doing he asked lighting a fire catelyn told him she found a dressing gown and shrugged into it then knelt over the cold hearth maester luwin ned began maester luwin has delivered all my children catelyn said this is no time for false modesty she slid the paper in among the kindling and placed the heavier logs on top of it ned crossed the room took her by the arm and pulled her to her feet he held her there his face inches from her my lady tell me what was this message catelyn stiffened in his grasp a warning she said softly if we have the wits to hear his eyes searched her face go on lysa says jon arryn was murdered his fingers tightened on her arm by whom the lannisters she told him the queen ned released his hold on her arm there were deep red marks on her skin gods he whispered his voice was hoarse your sister is sick with grief she cannot know what she is saying she knows catelyn said lysa is impulsive yes but this message was carefully planned cleverly hidden she knew it meant death if her letter fell into the wrong hands to risk so much she must have had more than mere suspicion catelyn looked to her husband now we truly have no choice you must be roberts hand you must go south with him and learn the truth she saw at once that ned had reached a very different conclusion the only truths i know are here the south is a nest of adders i would do better to avoid luwin plucked at his chain collar where it had chafed the soft skin of his throat the hand of the king has great power my lord power to find the truth of lord arryns death to bring his killers to the kings justice power to protect lady arryn and her son if the worst be true ned glanced helplessly around the bedchamber catelyns heart went out to him but she knew she could not take him in her arms just then first the victory must be won for her childrens sake you say you love robert like a brother would you leave your brother surrounded by lannisters the others take both of you ned muttered darkly he turned away from them and went to the window she did not speak nor did the maester they waited quiet while eddard stark said a silent farewell to the home he loved when he turned away from the window at last his voice was tired and full of melancholy and moisture glittered faintly in the corners of his eyes my father went south once to answer the summons of a king he never came home again a different time maester luwin said a different king yes ned said dully he seated himself in a chair by the hearth catelyn you shall stay here in winterfell his words were like an icy draft through her heart no she said suddenly afraid was this to be her punishment never to see his face again nor to feel his arms around her yes ned said in words that would brook no argument you must govern the north in my stead while i run roberts errands there must always be a stark in winterfell robb is fourteen soon enough he will be a man grown he must learn to rule and i will not be here for him make him part of your councils he must be ready when his time comes gods will not for many years maester luwin murmured maester luwin i trust you as i would my own blood give my wife your voice in all things great and small teach my son the things he needs to know winter is coming maester luwin nodded gravely then silence fell until catelyn found her courage and asked the question whose answer she most dreaded what of the other children ned stood and took her in his arms and held her face close to his rickon is very young he said gently he should stay here with you and robb the others i would take with me i could not bear it catelyn said trembling you must he said sansa must wed joffrey that is clear now we must give them no grounds to suspect our devotion and it is past time that arya learned the ways of a southron court in a few years she will be of an age to marry too sansa would shine in the south catelyn thought to herself and the gods knew that arya needed refinement reluctantly she let go of them in her heart but not bran never bran yes she said but please ned for the love you bear me let bran remain here at winterfell he is only seven i was eight when my father sent me to foster at the eyrie ned said ser rodrik tells me there is bad feeling between robb and prince joffrey that is not healthy bran can bridge that distance he is a sweet boy quick to laugh easy to love let him grow up with the young princes let him become their friend as robert became mine our house will be the safer for it he was right catelyn knew it it did not make the pain any easier to bear she would lose all four of them then ned and both girls and her sweet loving bran only robb and little rickon would be left to her she felt lonely already winterfell was such a vast place keep him off the walls then she said bravely you know how bran loves to climb ned kissed the tears from her eyes before they could fall thank you my lady he whispered this is hard i know what of jon snow my lord maester luwin asked catelyn tensed at the mention of the name ned felt the anger in her and pulled away many men fathered bastards catelyn had grown up with that knowledge it came as no surprise to her in the first year of her marriage to learn that ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met on campaign he had a mans needs after all and they had spent that year apart ned off at war in the south while she remained safe in her fathers castle at riverrun her thoughts were more of robb the infant at her breast than of the husband she scarcely knew he was welcome to whatever solace he might find between battles and if his seed quickened she expected he would see to the childs needs he did more than that the starks were not like other men ned brought his bastard home with him and called him son for all the north to see when the wars were over at last and catelyn rode to winterfell jon and his wet nurse had already taken up residence that cut deep ned would not speak of the mother not so much as a word but a castle has no secrets and catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husbands soldiers they whispered of ser arthur dayne the sword of the morning deadliest of the seven knights of aeryss kingsguard and of how their young lord had slain him in single combat and they told how afterward ned had carried ser arthurs sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called starfall on the shores of the summer sea the lady ashara dayne tall and fair with haunting violet eyes it had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage but finally in bed one night catelyn had asked her husband the truth of it asked him to his face that was the only time in all their years that ned had ever frightened her never ask me about jon he said cold as ice he is my blood and that is all you need to know and now i will learn where you heard that name my lady she had pledged to obey she told him and from that day on the whispering had stopped and ashara daynes name was never heard in winterfell again whoever jons mother had been ned must have loved her fiercely for nothing catelyn said would persuade him to send the boy away it was the one thing she could never forgive him she had come to love her husband with all her heart but she had never found it in her to love jon she might have overlooked a dozen bastards for neds sake so long as they were out of sight jon was never out of sight and as he grew he looked more like ned than any of the trueborn sons she bore him somehow that made it worse jon must go she said now he and robb are close ned said i had hoped he cannot stay here catelyn said cutting him off he is your son not mine i will not have him it was hard she knew but no less the truth ned would do the boy no kindness by leaving him here at winterfell the look ned gave her was anguished you know i cannot take him south there will be no place for him at court a boy with a bastards name you know what they will say of him he will be shunned catelyn armored her heart against the mute appeal in her husbands eyes they say your friend robert has fathered a dozen bastards himself and none of them has ever been seen at court ned blazed the lann ister woman has seen to that how can you be so damnably cruel catelyn he is only a boy he his fury was on him he might have said more and worse but maester luwin cut in another solution presents itself he said his voice quiet your brother benjen came to me about jon a few days ago it seems the boy aspires to take the black ned looked shocked he asked to join the nights watch catelyn said nothing let ned work it out in his own mind her voice would not be welcome now yet gladly would she have kissed the maester just then his was the perfect solution benjen stark was a sworn brother jon would be a son to him the child he would never have and in time the boy would take the oath as well he would father no sons who might someday contest with catelyns own grandchildren for winterfell maester luwin said there is great honor in service on the wall my lord and even a bastard may rise high in the nights watch ned reflected still his voice was troubled jon is so young if he asked this when he was a man grown that would be one thing but a boy of fourteen a hard sacrifice maester luwin agreed yet these are hard times my lord his road is no crueler than yours or your ladys catelyn thought of the three children she must lose it was not easy keeping silent then ned turned away from them to gaze out the window his long face silent and thoughtful finally he sighed and turned back very well he said to maester luwin i suppose it is for the best i will speak to ben when shall we tell jon the maester asked when i must preparations must be made it will be a fortnight before we are ready to depart i would sooner let jon enjoy these last few days summer will end soon enough and childhood as well when the time comes i will tell him myself arya a ryas stitches were crooked again she frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister sansa sat among the other girls sansas needlework was exquisite everyone said so sansas work is as pretty as she is septa mordane told their lady mother once she has such fine delicate hands when lady catelyn had asked about arya the septa had sniffed arya has the hands of a blacksmith arya glanced furtively across the room worried that septa mordane might have read her thoughts but the septa was paying her no attention today she was sitting with the princess myrcella all smiles and admiration it was not often that the septa was privileged to instruct a royal princess in the womanly arts as she had said when the queen brought myrcella to join them arya thought that myrcellas stitches looked a little crooked too but you would never know it from the way septa mordane was cooing she studied her own work again looking for some way to salvage it then sighed and put down the needle she looked glumly at her sister sansa was chatting away happily as she worked beth cassel ser rodriks little girl was sitting by her feet listening to every word she said and jeyne poole was leaning over to whisper something in her ear what are you talking about arya asked suddenly jeyne gave her a startled look then giggled sansa looked abashed beth blushed no one answered tell me arya said jeyne glanced over to make certain that septa mordane was not listening myrcella said something then and the septa laughed along with the rest of the ladies we were talking about the prince sansa said her voice soft as a kiss arya knew which prince she meant jofftey of course the tall handsome one sansa got to sit with him at the feast arya had to sit with the little fat one naturally joffrey likes your sister jeyne whispered proud as if she had something to do with it she was the daughter of winterfells steward and sansas dearest friend he told her she was very beautiful hes going to marry her little beth said dreamily hugging herself then sansa will be queen of all the realm sansa had the grace to blush she blushed prettily she did everything prettily arya thought with dull resentment beth you shouldnt make up stories sansa corrected the younger girl gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her words she looked at arya what did you think of prince joff sister hes very gallant dont you think jon says he looks like a girl arya said sansa sighed as she stitched poor jon she said he gets jealous because hes a bastard hes our brother arya said much too loudly her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower room septa mordane raised her eyes she had a bony face sharp eyes and a thin lipless mouth made for frowning it was frowning now what are you talking about children our half brother sansa corrected soft and precise she smiled for the septa arya and i were remarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with us today she said septa mordane nodded indeed a great honor for us all princess myrcella smiled uncertainly at the compliment arya why arent you at work the septa asked she rose to her feet starched skirts rustling as she started across the room let me see your stitches arya wanted to scream it was just like sansa to go and attract the septas attention here she said surrendering up her work the septa examined the fabric arya arya arya she said this will not do this will not do at all everyone was looking at her it was too much sansa was too well bred to smile at her sisters disgrace but jeyne was smirking on her behalf even princess myrcella looked sorry for her arya felt tears filling her eyes she pushed herself out of her chair and bolted for the door septa mordane called after her arya come back here dont you take another step your lady mother will hear of this in front of our royal princess too youll shame us all arya stopped at the door and turned back biting her lip the tears were running down her cheeks now she managed a stiff little bow to myrcella by your leave my lady myrcella blinked at her and looked to her ladies for guidance but if she was uncertain septa mordane was not just where do you think you are going arya the septa demanded arya glared at her i have to go shoe a horse she said sweetly taking a brief satisfaction in the shock on the septas face then she whirled and made her exit running down the steps as fast as her feet would take her it wasnt fair sansa had everything sansa was two years older maybe by the time arya had been born there had been nothing left often it felt that way sansa could sew and dance and sing she wrote poetry she knew how to dress she played the high harp and the bells worse she was beautiful sansa had gotten their mothers fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the tullys arya took after their lord father her hair was a lusterless brown and her face was long and solemn jeyne used to call her arya horseface and neigh whenever she came near it hurt that the one thing arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse well that and manage a household sansa had never had much of a head for figures if she did marry prince joff arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward nymeria was waiting for her in the guardroom at the base of the stairs she bounded to her feet as soon as she caught sight of arya arya grinned the wolf pup loved her even if no one else did they went everywhere together and nymeria slept in her room at the foot of her bed if mother had not forbidden it arya would gladly have taken the wolf with her to needlework let septa mordane complain about her stitches then nymeria nipped eagerly at her hand as arya untied her she had yellow eyes when they caught the sunlight they gleamed like two golden coins arya had named her after the warrior queen of the rhoyne who had led her people across the narrow sea that had been a great scandal too sansa of course had named her pup lady arya made a face and hugged the wolfling tight nymeria licked her ear and she giggled by now septa mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother if she went to her room they would find her arya did not care to be found she had a better notion the boys were at practice in the yard she wanted to see robb put gallant prince joffrey flat on his back come she whispered to nymeria she got up and ran the wolf coming hard at her heels there was a window in the covered bridge between the armory and the great keep where you had a view of the whole yard that was where they headed they arrived flushed and breathless to find jon seated on the sill one leg drawn up languidly to his chin he was watching the action so absorbed that he seemed unaware of her approach until his white wolf moved to meet them nymeria stalked closer on wary feet ghost already larger than his litter mates smelled her gave her ear a careful nip and settled back down jon gave her a curious look shouldnt you be working on your stitches little sister arya made a face at him i wanted to see them fight he smiled come here then arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard below to her disappointment it was the younger boys drilling bran was so heavily padded he looked as though he had belted on a featherbed and prince tommen who was plump to begin with seemed positively round they were huffing and puffing and hitting at each other with padded wooden swords under the watchful eye of old ser rodrik cassel the master at arms a great stout keg of a man with magnificent white cheek whiskers a dozen spectators man and boy were calling out encouragement robbs voice the loudest among them she spotted theon greyjoy beside him his black doublet emblazoned with the golden kraken of his house a look of wry contempt on his face both of the combatants were staggering arya judged that they had been at it awhile a shade more exhausting than needlework jon observed a shade more fun than needlework arya gave back at him jon grinned reached over and messed up her hair arya flushed they had always been close jon had their fathers face as she did they were the only ones robb and sansa and bran and even little rickon all took after the tullys with easy smiles and fire in their hair when arya had been little she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too it been jon she had gone to in her fear and jon who had reassured her georgl r r martin why arent you down in the yard arya asked him he gave her a half smile bastards are not allowed to damage young princes he said any bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords oh arya felt abashed she should have realized for the second time today arya reflected that life was not fair she watched her little brother whack at tommen i could do just as good as bran she said hes only seven im nine jon looked her over with all his fourteen year old wisdom youre too skinny he said he took her arm to feel her muscle then he sighed and shook his head i doubt you could even lift a longsword little sister never mind swing one arya snatched back her arm and glared at him jon messed up her hair again they watched bran and tommen circle each other you see prince joffrey jon asked she hadnt not at first glance but when she looked again she found him to the back under the shade of the high stone wall he was surrounded by men she did not recognize young squires in the livery of lannister and baratheon strangers all there were a few older men among them knights she surmised look at the arms on his surcoat jon suggested arya looked an ornate shield had been embroidered on the princes padded surcoat no doubt the needlework was exquisite the arms were divided down the middle on one side was the crowned stag of the royal house on the other the lion of lannister the lannisters are proud jon observed youd think the royal sigil would be sufficient but no he makes his mothers house equal in honor to the kings the woman is important too arya protested jon chuckled perhaps you should do the same thing little sister wed tully to stark in your arms a wolf with a fish in its mouth it made her laugh that would look silly besides if a girl cant fight why should she have a coat of arms jon shrugged girls get the arms but not the swords bastards get the swords but not the arms i did not make the rules little sister there was a shout from the courtyard below prince tommen was rolling in the dust trying to get up and failing all the padding made him look like a turtle on its back bran was standing over him with upraised wooden sword ready to whack him again once he regained his feet the men began to laugh enough ser rodrik called out he gave the prince a hand and yanked him back to his feet well fought lew donnis help them out of their armor he looked around prince joffrey robb will you go another round robb already sweaty from a previous bout moved forward eagerly gladly joffrey moved into the sunlight in response to rodriks summons his hair shone like spun gold he looked bored this is a game for children ser rodrik theon greyjoy gave a sudden bark of laughter you are children he said derisively robb may be a child joffrey said i am a prince and i grow tired of swatting at starks with a play sword you got more swats than you gave joff robb said are you afraid prince joffrey looked at him oh terrified he said youre so much older some of the lannister men laughed jon looked down on the scene with a frown joffrey is truly a little shit he told arya ser rodrik tugged thoughtfully at his white whiskers what are you suggesting he asked the prince live steel done robb shot back youll be sorry the master at arms put a hand on robbs shoulder to quiet him live steel is too dangerous i will permit you tourney swords with blunted edges joffrey said nothing but a man strange to arya a tall knight with black hair and burn scars on his face pushed forward in front of the prince this is your prince who are you to tell him he may not have an edge on his sword ser master at arms of winterfell clegane and you would do well not to forget it are you training women here the burned man wanted to know he was muscled like a bull i am training knights ser rodrik said pointedly they will have steel when they are ready when they are of an age the burned man looked at robb how old are you boy fourteen robb said i killed a man at twelve you can be sure it was not with a blunt sword arya could see robb bristle his pride was wounded he turned on ser rodrik let me do it i can beat him beat him with a tourney blade then ser rodrik said joffrey shrugged come and see me when youre older stark if youre not too old there was laughter from the lannister men robbs curses rang through the yard arya covered her mouth in shock theon greyjoy seized robbs arm to keep him away from the prince ser rodrik tugged at his whiskers in dismay joffrey feigned a yawn and turned to his younger brother come tommen he said the hour of play is done leave the children to their frolics that brought more laughter from the lannisters more curses from robb ser rodriks face was beet red with fury under the white of his whiskers theon kept robb locked in an iron grip until the princes and their party were safely away jon watched them leave and arya watched jon his face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of the godswood finally he climbed down off the window the show is done he said he bent to scratch ghost behind the ears the white wolf rose and rubbed against him you had best run back to your room little sister septa mordane will surely be lurking the longer you hide the sterner the penance youll be sewing all through winter when the spring thaw comes they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers arya didnt think it was funny i hate needlework she said with passion its not fair nothing is fair jon said he messed up her hair again and walked away from her ghost moving silently beside him nymeria started to follow too then stopped and came back when she saw that arya was not coming reluctantly she turned in the other direction it was worse than jon had thought it wasnt septa mordane waiting in her room it was septa mordane and her mother bran the hunt left at dawn the king wanted wild boar at the feast tonight prince joffrey rode with his father so robb had been allowed to join the hunters as well uncle benjen jory theon greyjoy ser rodrik and even the queens funny little brother had all ridden out with them it was the last hunt after all on the morrow they left for the south bran had been left behind with jon and the girls and rickon but rickon was only a baby and the girls were only girls and jon and his wolf were nowhere to be found bran did not look for him very hard he thought jon was angry at him jon seemed to be angry at everyone these days bran did not know why he was going with uncle ben to the wall to join the nights watch that was almost as good as going south with the king robb was the one they were leaving behind not jon for days bran could scarcely wait to be off he was going to ride the kingsroad on a horse of his own not a pony but a real horse his father would be the hand of the king and they were going to live in the red castle at kings landing the castle the dragonlords had built old nan said there were ghosts there and dungeons where terrible things had been done and dragon heads on the walls it gave bran a shiver just to think of it but he was not afraid how could he be afraid his father would be with him and the king with all his knights and sworn swords bran was going to be a knight himself someday one of the kingsguard old nan said they were the finest swords in all the realm there were only seven of them and they wore white armor and had no wives or children but lived only to serve the king bran knew all the stories their names were like music to him serwyn of the mirror shield ser ryam redwyne prince aemon the dragonknight the twins ser erryk and ser arryk who had died on one anothers swords hundreds of years ago when brother fought sister in the war the singers called the dance of the dragons the white bull gerold hightower ser arthur dayne the sword of the morning barristan the bold two of the kingsguard had come north with king robert bran had watched them with fascination never quite daring to speak to them ser boros was a bald man with a jowly face and ser meryn had droopy eyes and a beard the color of rust ser jaime lannister looked more like the knights in the stories and he was of the kingsguard too but robb said he had killed the old mad king and shouldnt count anymore the greatest living knight was ser barristan selmy barristan the bold the lord commander of the kingsguard father had promised that they would meet ser barristan when they reached kings landing and bran had been marking the days on his wall eager to depart to see a world he had only dreamed of and begin a life he could scarcely imagine yet now that the last day was at hand suddenly bran felt lost winterfell had been the only home he had ever known his father had told him that he ought to say his farewells today and he had tried after the hunt had ridden out he wandered through the castle with his wolf at his side intending to visit the ones who would be left behind old nan and gage the cook mikken in his smithy hodor the stableboy who smiled so much and took care of his pony and never said anything but hodor the man in the glass gardens who gave him a blackberry when he came to visit but it was no good he had gone to the stable first and seen his pony there in its stall except it wasnt his pony anymore he was getting a real horse and leaving the pony behind and all of a sudden bran just wanted to sit down and cry he turned and ran off before hodor and the other stableboys could see the tears in his eyes that was the end of his farewells instead bran spent the morning alone in the godswood trying to teach his wolf to fetch a stick and failing the wolfling was smarter than any of the hounds in his fathers kennel and bran would have sworn he understood every word that was said to him but he showed very little interest in chasing sticks he was still trying to decide on a name robb was calling his grey wind because he ran so fast sansa had named hers lady and arya named hers after some old witch queen in the songs and little rickon called his shaggydog which bran thought was a pretty stupid name for a direwolf jons wolf the white one was ghost bran wished he had thought of that first even though his wolf wasnt white he had tried a hundred names in the last fortnight but none of them sounded right finally he got tired of the stick game and decided to go climbing he hadnt been up to the broken tower for weeks with everything that had happened and this might be his last chance he raced across the godswood taking the long way around to avoid the pool where the heart tree grew the heart tree had always frightened him trees ought not have eyes bran thought or leaves that looked like hands his wolf came sprinting at his heels you stay here he told him at the base of the sentinel tree near the armory wall lie down thats right now stay the wolf did as he was told bran scratched him behind the ears then turned away jumped grabbed a low branch and pulled himself up he was halfway up the tree moving easily from limb to limb when the wolf got to his feet and began to howl bran looked back down his wolf fell silent staring up at him through slitted yellow eyes a strange chill went through him he began to climb again once more the wolf howled quiet he yelled sit down stay youre worse than mother the howling chased him all the way up the tree until finally he jumped off onto the armory roof and out of sight the rooftops of winterfell were brans second home his mother often said that bran could climb before he could walk bran could not remember when he first learned to walk but he could not remember when he started to climb either so he supposed it must be true to a boy winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and tunnels spreading out in all directions in the older parts of the castle the halls slanted up and down so that you couldnt even be sure what floor you were on the place had grown over the centuries like some monstrous stone tree maester luwin told him once and its branches were gnarled and thick and twisted its roots sunk deep into the earth when he got out from under it and scrambled up near the sky bran could see all of winterfell in a glance he liked the way it looked spread out beneath him only birds wheeling over his head while all the life of the castle went on below bran could perch for hours among the shapeless rain worn gargoyles that brooded over the first keep watching it all the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard the cooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels the silence of the godswood the girls gossiping beside the washing well it made him feel like he was lord of the castle in a way even robb would never know it taught him winterfells secrets too the builders had not even leveled the earth there were hills and valleys behind the walls of winterfell there was a covered bridge that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower across to the second floor of the rookery bran knew about that and he knew you could get inside the inner wall by the south gate climb three floors and run all the way around winterfell through a narrow tunnel in the stone and then come out on ground level at the north gate with a hundred feet of wall looming over you even maester luwin didnt know that bran was convinced his mother was terrified that one day bran would slip off a wall and kill himself he told her that he wouldnt but she never believed him once she made him promise that he would stay on the ground he had managed to keep that promise for almost a fortnight miserable every day until one night he had gone out the window of his bedroom when his brothers were fast asleep he confessed his crime the next day in a fit of guilt lord eddard ordered him to the godswood to cleanse himself guards were posted to see that bran remained there alone all night to reflect on his disobedience the next morning bran was nowhere to be seen they finally found him fast asleep in the upper branches of the tallest sentinel in the grove as angry as he was his father could not help but laugh youre not my son he told bran when they fetched him down youre a squirrel so be it if you must climb then climb but try not to let your mother see you bran did his best although he did not think he ever really footed her since his father would not forbid it she turned to others old nan told him a story about a bad little boy who climbed too high and was struck down by lightning and how afterward the crows came to peck out his eyes bran was not impressed there were crows nests atop the broken tower where no one ever went but him and sometimes he filled his pockets with corn before he climbed up there and the crows ate it right out of his hand none of them had ever shown the slightest bit of interest in pecking out his eyes later maester luwin built a little pottery boy and dressed him in brans clothes and flung him off the wall into the yard below to demonstrate what would happen to bran if he fell that had been fun but afterward bran just looked at the maester and said im not made of clay and anyhow i never fall then for a while the guards would chase him whenever they saw him on the roofs and try to haul him down that was the best time of all it was like playing a game with his brothers except that bran always won none of the guards could climb half so well as bran not even jory most of the time they never saw him anyway people never looked up that was another thing he liked about climbing it was almost like being invisible he liked how it felt too pulling himself up a wall stone by stone fingers and toes digging hard into the small crevices between he always took off his boots and went barefoot when he climbed it made him feel as if he had four hands instead of two he liked the deep sweet ache it left in the muscles afterward he liked the way the air tasted way up high sweet and cold as a winter peach he liked the birds the crows in the broken tower the tiny little sparrows that nested in cracks between the stones the ancient owl that slept in the dusty loft above the old armory bran knew them all most of all he liked going places that no one else could go and seeing the grey sprawl of winterfell in a way that no one else ever saw it it made the whole castle brans secret place his favorite haunt was the broken tower once it had been a watchtower the tallest in winterfell a long time ago a hundred years before even his father had been born a lightning strike had set it afire the top third of the structure had collapsed inward and the tower had never been rebuilt sometimes his father sent ratters into the base of the tower to clean out the nests they always found among the jumble of fallen stones and charred and rotten beams but no one ever got up to the jagged top of the structure now except for bran and the crows he knew two ways to get there you could climb straight up the side of the tower itself but the stones were loose the mortar that held them together long gone to ash and bran never liked to put his full weight on them the best way was to start from the godswood shinny up the tall sentinel and cross over the armory and the guards hall leaping roof to roof barefoot so the guards wouldnt hear you overhead that brought you up to the blind side of the first keep the oldest part of the castle a squat round fortress that was taller than it looked only rats and spiders lived there now but the old stones still made for good climbing you could go straight up to where the gargoyles leaned out blindly over empty space and swing from gargoyle to gargoyle hand over hand around to the north side from there if you really stretched you could reach out and pull yourself over to the broken tower where it leaned close the last part was the scramble up the blackened stones to the eyrie no more than ten feet and then the crows would come round to see if youd brought any corn bran was moving from gargoyle to gargoyle with the ease of long practice when he heard the voices he was so startled he almost lost his grip the first keep had been empty all his life i do not like it a woman was saying there was a row of windows beneath him and the voice was drifting out of the last window on this side you should be the hand gods forbid a mans voice replied lazily its not an honor id want theres far too much work involved bran hung listening suddenly afraid to go on they might glimpse his feet if he tried to swing by dont you see the danger this puts us in the woman said robert loves the man like a brother robert can barely stomach his brothers not that i blame him stannis would be enough to give anyone indigestion dont play the fool stannis and renly are one thing and eddard stark is quite another robert will listen to stark damn them both i should have insisted that he name you but i was certain stark would refuse him we ought to count ourselves fortunate the man said the king might as easily have named one of his brothers or even littlefinger gods help us give me honorable enemies rather than ambitious ones and ill sleep more easily by night they were talking about father bran realized he wanted to hear more a few more feet but they would see him if he swung out in front of the window we will have to watch him carefully the woman said i would sooner watch you the man said he sounded bored come back here lord eddard has never taken any interest in anything that happened south of the neck the woman said never i tell you he means to move against us why else would he leave the seat of his power a hundred reasons duty honor he yearns to write his name large across the book of history to get away from his wife or both perhaps he just wants to be warm for once in his life his wife is lady arryns sister its a wonder lysa was not here to greet us with her accusations bran looked down there was a narrow ledge beneath the window only a few inches wide he tried to lower himself toward it too far he would never reach you fret too much lysa arryn is a frightened cow that frightened cow shared jon arryns bed if she knew anything she would have gone to robert before she fled kings landing when he had already agreed to foster that weakling son of hers at casterly rock i think not she knew the boys life would be hostage to her silence she may grow bolder now that hes safe atop the eyrie mothers the man made the word sound like a curse i think birthing does something to your minds you are all mad he laughed it was a bitter sound let lady arryn grow as bold as she likes whatever she knows whatever she thinks she knows she has no proof he paused a moment or does she do you think the king will require proof the woman said i tell you he loves me not and whose fault is that sweet sister bran studied the ledge he could drop down it was too narrow to land on but if he could catch hold as he fell past pull himself up except that might make a noise draw them to the window he was not sure what he was hearing but he knew it was not meant for his ears you are as blind as robert the woman was saying if you mean i see the same thing yes the man said i see a man who would sooner die than betray his king he betrayed one already or have you forgotten the woman said oh i dont deny hes loyal to robert thats obvious what happens when robert dies and joff takes the throne and the sooner that comes to pass the safer well all be my husband grows more restless every day having stark beside him will only make him worse hes still in love with the sister the insipid little dead sixteen year old how long till he decides to put me aside for some new lyanna bran was suddenly very frightened he wanted nothing so much as to go back the way he had come to find his brothers only what would he tell them he had to get closer bran realized he had to see who was talking the man sighed you should think less about the future and more about the pleasures at hand stop that the woman said bran heard the sudden slap of flesh on flesh then the mans laughter bran pulled himself up climbed over the gargoyle crawled out onto the roof this was the easy way he moved across the roof to the next gargoyle right above the window of the room where they were talking all this talk is getting very tiresome sister the man said come here and be quiet bran sat astride the gargoyle tightened his legs around it and swung himself around upside down he hung by his legs and slowly stretched his head down toward the window the world looked strange upside down a courtyard swam dizzily below him its stones still wet with melted snow bran looked in the window inside the room a man and a woman were wrestling they were both naked bran could not tell who they were the mans back was to him and his body screened the woman from view as he pushed her up against a wall there were soft wet sounds bran realized they were kissing he watched wide eyed and frightened his breath tight in his throat the man had a hand down between her legs and he must have been hurting her there because the woman started to moan low in her throat stop it she said stop it stop it oh please but her voice was low and weak and she did not push him away her hands buried themselves in his hair his tangled golden hair and pulled his face down to her breast bran saw her face her eyes were closed and her mouth was open moaning her golden hair swung from side to side as her head moved back and forth but still he recognized the queen he must have made a noise suddenly her eyes opened and she was staring right at him she screamed everything happened at once then the woman pushed the man away wildly shouting and pointing bran tried to pull himself up bending double as he reached for the gargoyle he as in too much of a hurry his hand scraped uselessly across smooth stone and in his panic his legs slipped and suddenly he was failing there was an instant of vertigo a sickening lurch as the window flashed past he shot out a hand grabbed for the ledge lost it caught it again with his other hand he swung against the building hard the impact took the breath out of him bran dangled one handed panting faces appeared in the window above him the queen and now bran recognized the man beside her they looked as much alike as reflections in a mirror he saw us the woman said shrilly so he did the man said brans fingers started to slip he grabbed the ledge with his other hand fingernails dug into unyielding stone the man reached down take my hand he said before you fall bran seized his arm and held on tight with all his strength the man yanked him up to the ledge what are you doing the woman demanded the man ignored her he was very strong he stood bran up on the sill how old are you boy seven bran said shaking with relief his fingers had dug deep gouges in the mans forearm he let go sheepishly the man looked over at the woman the things i do for love he said with loathing he gave bran a shove screaming bran went backward out the window into empty air there was nothing to grab on to the courtyard rushed up to meet him somewhere off in the distance a wolf was howling crows circled the broken tower waiting for corn tyrion somewhere in the great stone maze of winterfell a wolf howled the sound hung over the castle like a flag of mourning tyrion lannister looked up from his books and shivered though the library was snug and warm something about the howling of a wolf took a man right out of his here and now and left him in a dark forest of the mind running naked before the pack when the direwolf howled again tyrion shut the heavy leatherbound cover on the book he was reading a hundredyear old discourse on the changing of the seasons by a long dead maester he covered a yawn with the back of his hand his reading lamp was flickering its oil all but gone as dawn light leaked through the high windows he had been at it all night but that was nothing new tyrion lannister was not much a one for sleeping his legs were stiff and sore as he eased down off the bench he massaged some life back into them and limped heavily to the table where the septon was snoring softly his head pillowed on an open book in front of him tyrion glanced at the title a life of the grand maester aethelmure no wonder chayle he said softly the young man jerked up blinking confused the crystal of his order swinging wildly on its silver chain im off to break my fast see that you return the books to the shelves be gentle with the valyrian scrolls the parchment is very dry ayrmidons engines of war is quite rare and yours is the only complete copy ive ever seen chayle gaped at him still halfasleep patiently tyrion repeated his instructions then clapped the septon on the shoulder and left him to his tasks outside tyrion swallowed a lungful of the cold morning air and began his laborious descent of the steep stone steps that corkscrewed around the exterior of the library tower it was slow going the steps were cut high and narrow while his legs were short and twisted the rising sun had not yet cleared the walls of winterfell but the men were already hard at it in the yard below sandor cleganes rasping voice drifted up to him the boy is a long time dying i wish he would be quicker about it tyrion glanced down and saw the hound standing with young joffrey as squires swarmed around them at least he dies quietly the prince replied its the wolf that makes the noise i could scarce sleep last night clegane cast a long shadow across the hard packed earth as his squire lowered the black helm over his head i could silence the creature if it please you he said through his open visor his boy placed a longsword in his hand he tested the weight of it slicing at the cold morning air behind him the yard rang to the clangor of steel on steel the notion seemed to delight the prince send a dog to kill a dog he exclaimed winterfell is so infested with wolves the starks would never miss one tyrion hopped off the last step onto the yard i beg to differ nephew he said the starks can count past six unlike some princes i might name joffrey had the grace at least to blush a voice from nowhere sandor said he peered through his helm looking this way and that spirits of the air the prince laughed as he always laughed when his bodyguard did this mummers farce tyrion was used to it down here the tall man peered down at the ground and pretended to notice him the little lord tyrion he said my pardons i did not see you standing there i am in no mood for your insolence today tyrion turned to his nephew joffrey it is past time you called on lord eddard and his lady to offer them your comfort joffrey looked as petulant as only a boy prince can look what good will my comfort do them none tyrion said yet it is expected of you your absence has been noted the stark boy is nothing to me joffrey said i cannot abide the wailing of women tyrion lannister reached up and slapped his nephew hard across the face the boys cheek began to redden one word tyrion said and i will hit you again im going to tell mother joffrey exclaimed tyrion hit him again now both cheeks flamed you tell your mother tyrion told him but first you get yourself to lord and lady stark and you fall to your knees in front of them and you tell them how very sorry you are and that you are at their service if there is the slightest thing you can do for them or theirs in this desperate hour and that all your prayers go with them do you understand do you the boy looked as though he was going to cry instead he managed a weak nod then he turned and fled headlong from the yard holding his cheek tyrion watched him run a shadow fell across his face he turned to find clegane looming overhead like a cliff his soot dark armor seemed to blot out the sun he had lowered the visor on his helm it was fashioned in the likeness of a snarling black hound fearsome to behold but tyrion had always thought it a great improvement over cleganes hideously burned face the prince will remember that little lord the hound warned him the helm turned his laugh into a hollow rumble i pray he does tyrion lannister replied if he forgets be a good dog and remind him he glanced around the courtyard do you know where i might find my brother breaking fast with the queen ah tyrion said he gave sandor clegane a perfunctory nod and walked away as briskly as his stunted legs would carry him whistling he pitied the first knight to try the hound today the man did have a temper a cold cheerless meal had been laid out in the morning room of the guest house jaime sat at table with cersei and the children talking in low hushed voices is robert still abed tyrion asked as he seated himself uninvited at the table his sister peered at him with the same expression of faint distaste she had worn since the day he was born the king has not slept at all she told him he is with lord eddard he has taken their sorrow deeply to heart he has a large heart our robert jaime said with a lazy smile there was very little that jaime took seriously tyrion knew that about his brother and forgave it during all the terrible long years of his childhood only jaime had ever shown him the smallest measure of affection or respect and for that tyrion was willing to forgive him most anything a servant approached bread tyrion told him and two of those little fish and a mug of that good dark beer to wash them down oh and some bacon burn it until it turns black the man bowed and moved off tyrion turned back to his siblings twins male and female they looked very much the part this morning both had chosen a deep green that matched their eyes their blond curls were all a fashionable tumble and gold ornaments shone at wrists and fingers and throats tyrion wondered what it would be like to have a twin and decided that he would rather not know bad enough to face himself in a looking glass every day another him was a thought too dreadful to contemplate prince tommen spoke up do you have news of bran uncle i stopped by the sickroom last night tyrion announced there was no change the maester thought that a hopeful sign i dont want brandon to die tommen said timorously he was a sweet boy not like his brother but then jaime and tyrion were somewhat less than peas in a pod themselves lord eddard had a brother named brandon as well jaime mused one of the hostages murdered by targaryen it seems to be an unlucky name oh not so unlucky as all that surely tyrion said the servant brought his plate he ripped off a chunk of black bread cersei was studying him warily what do you mean tyrion gave her a crooked smile why only that tommen may get his wish the maester thinks the boy may yet live he took a sip of beer myrcella gave a happy gasp and tommen smiled nervously but it was not the children tyrion was watching the glance that passed between jaime and cersei lasted no more than a second but he did not miss it then his sister dropped her gaze to the table that is no mercy these northern gods are cruel to let the child linger in such pain what were the maesters words jaime asked the bacon crunched when he bit into it tyrion chewed thoughtfully for a moment and said he thinks that if the boy were going to die he would have done so already it has been four days with no change will bran get better uncle little myrcella asked she had all of her mothers beauty and none of her nature his back is broken little one tyrion told her the fall shattered his legs as well they keep him alive with honey and water or he would starve to death perhaps if he wakes he will be able to eat real food but he will never walk again if he wakes cersei repeated is that likely the gods alone know tyrion told her the maester only hopes he chewed some more bread i would swear that wolf of his is keeping the boy alive the creature is outside his window day and night howling every time they chase it away it returns the maester said they closed the window once to shut out the noise and bran seemed to weaken when they opened it again his heart beat stronger the queen shuddered there is something unnatural about those animals she said they are dangerous i will not have any of them coming south with us jaime said youll have a hard time stopping them sister they follow those girls everywhere tyrion started on his fish are you leaving soon then not near soon enough cersei said then she frowned are we leaving she echoed what about you gods dont tell me you are staying here tyrion shrugged benjen stark is returning to the nights watch with his brothers bastard i have a mind to go with them and see this wall we have all heard so much of jaime smiled i hope youre not thinking of taking the black on us sweet brother tyrion laughed what me celibate the whores would go begging from dorne to casterly rock no i just want to stand on top of the wall and piss off the edge of the world cersei stood abruptly the children dont need to hear this filth tommen myrcella come she strode briskly from the morning room her train and her pups trailing behind her jaime lannister regarded his brother thoughtfully with those cool green eyes stark will never consent to leave winterfell with his son lingering in the shadow of death he will if robert commands it tyrion said and robert will command it there is nothing lord eddard can do for the boy in any case he could end his torment jaime said i would if it were my son it would be a mercy i advise against putting that suggestion to lord eddard sweet brother tyrion said he would not take it kindly even if the boy does live he will be a cripple worse than a cripple a grotesque give me a good clean death tyrion replied with a shrug that accentuated the twist of his shoulders speaking for the grotesques he said i beg to differ death is so terribly final while life is full of possibilities jaime smiled you are a perverse little imp arent you oh yes tyrion admitted i hope the boy does wake i would be most interested to hear what he might have to say his brothers smile curdled like sour milk tyrion my sweet brother he said darkly there are times when you give me cause to wonder whose side you are on tyrions mouth was full of bread and fish he took a swallow of strong black beer to wash it all down and grinned up wolfishly at jaime why jaime my sweet brother he said you wound me you know how much i love my family jon on climbed the steps slowly trying not to think that this might be the last time ever ghost padded silently beside him outside snow swirled through the castle gates and the yard was all noise and chaos but inside the thick stone walls it was still warm and quiet too quiet for jons liking he reached the landing and stood for a long moment afraid ghost nuzzled at his hand he took courage from that he straightened and entered the room lady stark was there beside his bed she had been there day and night for close on a fortnight not for a moment had she left brans side she had her meals brought to her there and chamber pots as well and a small hard bed to sleep on though it was said she had scarcely slept at all she fed him herself the honey and water and herb mixture that sustained life not once did she leave the room so jon had stayed away but now there was no more time he stood in the door for a moment afraid to speak afraid to come closer the window was open below a wolf howled ghost heard and lifted his head lady stark looked over for a moment she did not seem to recognize him finally she blinked what areyou doing here she asked in a voice strangely flat and emotionless i came to see bran jon said to say good bye her face did not change her long auburn hair was dull and tangled she looked as though she had aged twenty years youve said it now go away part of him wanted only to flee but he knew that if he did he might never see bran again he took a nervous step into the room please he said something cold moved in her eyes i told you to leave she said we dont want you here once that would have sent him running once that might even have made him cry now it only made him angry he would be a sworn brother of the nights watch soon and face worse dangers than catelyn tully stark hes my brother he said shall i call the guards call them jon said defiant you cant stop me from seeing him he crossed the room keeping the bed between them and looked down on bran where he lay she was holding one of his hands it looked like a claw this was not the bran he remembered the flesh had all gone from him his skin stretched tight over bones like sticks under the blanket his legs bent in ways that made jon sick his eyes were sunken deep into black pits open but they saw nothing the fall had shrunken him somehow he looked half a leaf as if the first strong wind would carry him off to his grave yet under the frail cage of those shattered ribs his chest rose and fell with each shallow breath bran he said im sorry i didnt come before i was afraid he could feel the tears rolling down his cheeks jon no longer cared dont die bran please were all waiting for you to wake up me and robb and the girls everyone lady stark was watching she had not raised a cry jon took that for acceptance outside the window the direwolf howled again the wolf that bran had not had time to name i have to go now jon said uncle benjen is waiting im to go north to the wall we have to leave today before the snows come he remembered how excited bran had been at the prospect of the journey it was more than he could bear the thought of leaving him behind like this jon brushed away his tears leaned over and kissed his brother lightly on the lips i wanted him to stay here with me lady stark said softly jon watched her wary she was not even looking at him she was george r r martm talking to him but for a part of her it was as though he were not even in the room i prayed for it she said dully he was my special boy i went to the sept and prayed seven times to the seven faces of god that ned would change his mind and leave him here with me sometimes prayers are answered jon did not know what to say it wasnt your fault he managed after an awkward silence her eyes found him they were full of poison i need none of your absolution bastard jon lowered his eyes she was cradling one of brans hands he took the other squeezed it fingers like the bones of birds good bye he said he was at the door when she called out to him jon she said he should have kept going but she had never called him by his name before he turned to find her looking at his face as if she were seeing it for the first time yes he said it should have been you she told him then she turned back to bran and began to weep her whole body shaking with the sobs jon had never seen her cry before it was a long walk down to the yard outside everything was noise and confusion wagons were being loaded men were shouting horses were being harnessed and saddled and led from the stables a light snow had begun to fall and everyone was in an uproar to be off robb was in the middle of it shouting commands with the best of them he seemed to have grown of late as if brans fall and his mothers collapse had somehow made him stronger grey wind was at his side uncle benjen is looking for you he told jon he wanted to be gone an hour ago i know jon said soon he looked around at all the noise and confusion leaving is harder than i thought for me too robb said he had snow in his hair melting from the heat of his body did you see him jon nodded not trusting himself to speak hes not going to die robb said i know it you starks are hard to kill jon agreed his voice was flat and tired the visit had taken all the strength from him robb knew something was wrong my mother she was very kind jon told him robb looked relieved good he smiled the next time i see you youll be all in black jon forced himself to smile back it was always my color how long do you think it will be soon enough robb promised he pulled jon to him and embraced him fiercely farewell snow jon hugged him back and you stark take care of bran i will they broke apart and looked at each other awkwardly uncle benjen said to send you to the stables if i saw you robb finally said i have one more farewell to make jon told him then i havent seen you robb replied jon left him standing there in the snow surrounded by wagons and wolves and horses it was a short walk to the armory he picked up his package and took the covered bridge across to the keep arya was in her room packing a polished ironwood chest that was bigger than she was nymeria was helping arya would only have to point and the wolf would bound across the room snatch up some wisp of silk in her jaws and fetch it back but when she smelled ghost she sat down on her haunches and yelped at them arya glanced behind her saw jon and jumped to her feet she threw her skinny arms tight around his neck i was afraid you were gone she said her breath catching in her throat they wouldnt let me out to say good bye what did you do now jon was amused arya disentangled herself from him and made a face nothing i was all packed and everything she gestured at the huge chest no more than a third full and at the clothes that were scattered all over the room septa mordane says i have to do it all over my things werent properly folded she says a proper southron lady doesnt just throw her clothes inside her chest like old rags she says is that what you did little sister well theyre going to get all messed up anyway she said who cares how theyre folded septa mordane jon told her i dont think shed like nymeria helping either the she wolf regarded him silently with her dark golden eyes its just as well i have something for you to take with you and it has to be packed very carefully her face lit up a present you could call it that close the door wary but excited arya checked the hall nymeria here guard she left the wolf out there to warn of intruders and closed the door by then jon had pulled off the rags hed wrapped it in he held it out to her aryas eyes went wide dark eyes like his a sword she said in a small hushed breath the scabbard was soft grey leather supple as sin jon drew out the blade slowly so she could see the deep blue sheen of the steel this is no toy he told her be careful you dont cut yourself the edges are sharp enough to shave with girls dont shave arya said maybe they should have you ever seen the septas legs she giggled at him its so skinny so are you jon told her i had mikken make this special the bravos use swords like this in pentos and myr and the other free cities it wont hack a mans head off but it can poke him full of holes if youre fast enough i can be fast arya said youll have to work at it every day he put the sword in her hands showed her how to hold it and stepped back how does it feel do you like the balance i think so arya said first lesson jon said stick them with the pointy end arya gave him a whap on the arm with the flat of her blade the blow stung but jon found himself grinning like an idiot i know which end to use arya said a doubtful look crossed her face septa mordane will take it away from me not if she doesnt know you have it jon said who will i practice with youll find someone jon promised her kings landing is a true city a thousand times the size of winterfell until you find a partner watch how they fight in the yard run and ride make yourself strong and whatever you do arya knew what was coming next they said it together dont tell sansa jon messed up her hair i will miss you little sister suddenly she looked like she was going to cry i wish you were coming with us different roads sometimes lead to the same castle who knows he was feeling better now he was not going to let himself be sad i better go ill spend my first year on the wall emptying chamber pots if i keep uncle ben waiting any longer arya ran to him for a last hug put down the sword first jon warned her laughing she set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses when he turned back at the door she was holding it again trying it for balance i almost forgot he told her all the best swords have names like ice she said she looked at the blade in her hand does this have a name oh tell me cant you guess jon teased your very favorite thing arya seemed puzzled at first then it came to her she was that quick they said it together needle the memory of her laughter warmed him on the long ride north daenerys daenerys targaryen wed khal drogo with fear and barbaric splendor in a field beyond the walls of pentos for the dothraki believed that all things of importance in a mans life must be done beneath the open sky drogo had called his khalasar to attend him and they had come forty thousand dothraki warriors and uncounted numbers of women children and slaves outside the city walls they camped with their vast herds raising palaces of woven grass eating everything in sight and making the good folk of pentos more anxious with every passing day my fellow magisters have doubled the size of the city guard illyrio told them over platters of honey duck and orange snap peppers one night at the manse that had been drogos the khal had joined his khalasar his estate given over to daenerys and her brother until the wedding best we get princess daenerys wedded quickly before they hand half the wealth of pentos away to sellswords and bravos ser jorah mormont jested the exile had offered her brother his sword the night dany had been sold to kbal drogo viserys had accepted eagerly mormont had been their constant companion ever since magister illyrio laughed lightly through his forked beard but viserys did not so much as smile he can have her tomorrow if he likes her brother said he glanced over at dany and she lowered her eyes so long as he pays the price illyrio waved a languid hand in the air rings glittering on his fat fingers i have told you all is settled trust me the khal has promised you a crown and you shall have it yes but when when the khal chooses illyrio said he will have the girl first and after they are wed he must make his procession across the plains and present her to the dosh khaleen at vaes dolthrak after that perhaps if the omens favor war viserys seethed with impatience i piss on dothraki omens the usurper sits on my fathers throne how long must i wait illyrio gave a massive shrug you have waited most of your life great king what is another few months another few years ser jorah who had traveled as far east as vaes dothrak nodded in agreement i counsel you to be patient your grace the dothraki are true to their word but they do things in their own time a lesser man may beg a favor from the khal but must never presume to berate him viserys bristled guard your tongue mormont or ill have it out i am no lesser man i am the rightful lord of the seven kingdoms the dragon does not beg ser jorah lowered his eyes respectfully illyrio smiled enigmatically and tore a wing from the duck honey and grease ran over his fingers and dripped down into his beard as he nibbled at the tender meat there are no more dragons dany thought staring at her brother though she did not dare say it aloud yet that night she dreamt of one viserys was hitting her hurting her she was naked clumsy with fear she ran from him but her body seemed thick and ungainly he struck her again she stumbled and fell you woke the dragon he screamed as he kicked her you woke the dragon you woke the dragon her thighs were slick with blood she closed her eyes and whimpered as if in answer there was a hideous ripping sound and the crackling of some great fire when she looked again viserys was gone great columns of flame rose all around and in the midst of them was the dragon it turned its great head slowly when its molten eyes found hers she woke shaking and covered with a fine sheen of sweat she had never been so afraid until the day of her wedding came at last the ceremony began at dawn and continued until dusk an endless day of drinking and feasting and fighting a mighty earthen ramp had been raised amid the grass palaces and there dany was seated beside khal drogo above the seething sea of dothraki she had never seen so many people in one place nor people so strange and frightening the horselords might put on rich fabrics and sweet perfumes when they visited the free cities but out under the open sky they kept the old ways men and women alike wore painted leather vests over bare chests and horsehair leggings cinched by bronze medallion belts and the warriors greased their long braids with fat from the rendering pits they gorged themselves on horseflesh roasted with honey and peppers drank themselves blind on fermented mares milk and illyrios fine wines and spat jests at each other across the fires their voices harsh and alien in danys ears viserys was seated just below her splendid in a new black wool tunic with a scarlet dragon on the chest illyrio and ser jorah sat beside him theirs was a place of high honor just below the khals own bloodriders but dany could see the anger in her brothers lilac eyes he did not like sitting beneath her and he fumed when the slaves offered each dish first to the khal and his bride and served him from the portions they refused he could do nothing but nurse his resentment so nurse it he did his mood growing blacker by the hour at each insult to his person dany had never felt so alone as she did seated in the midst of that vast horde her brother had told her to smile and so she smiled until her face ached and the tears came unbidden to her eyes she did her best to hide them knowing how angry viserys would be if he saw her crying terrified of how khal drogo might react food was brought to her steaming joints of meat and thick black sausages and dothraki blood pies and later fruits and sweetgrass stews and delicate pastries from the kitchens of pentos but she waved it all away her stomach was a roil and she knew she could keep none of it down there was no one to talk to khal drogo shouted commands and jests down to his bloodriders and laughed at their replies but he scarcely glanced at dany beside him they had no common language dothraki was incomprehensible to her and the khal knew only a few words of the bastard valyrian of the free cities and none at all of the common tongue of the seven kingdoms she would even have welcomed the conversation of illyrio and her brother but they were too far below to hear her so she sat in her wedding silks nursing a cup of honeyed wine afraid to eat talking silently to herself i am blood of the dragon she told herself i am daenerys stormborn princess of dragonstone of the blood and seed of aegon the conqueror the sun was only a quarter of the way up the sky when she saw her first man die drums were beating as some of the women danced for the khal drogo watched without expression but his eyes followed their movements and from time to time he would toss down a bronze medallion for the women to fight over the warriors were watching too one of them finally stepped into the circle grabbed a dancer by the arm pushed her down to the ground and mounted her right there as a stallion mounts a mare illyrio had told her that might happen the dothraki mate like the animals in their herds there is no privacy in a khalasar and they do not understand sin or shame as we do dany looked away from the coupling frightened when she realized what was happening but a second warrior stepped forward and a third and soon there was no way to avert her eyes then two men seized the same woman she heard a shout saw a shove and in the blink of an eye the arakhs were out long razor sharp blades half sword and half scythe a dance of death began as the warriors circled and slashed leaping toward each other whirling the blades around their heads shrieking insults at each clash no one made a move to interfere it ended as quickly as it began the arakhs shivered together faster than dany could follow one man missed a step the other swung his blade in a flat arc steel bit into flesh just above the dothrakis waist and opened him from backbone to belly button spilling his entrails into the dust as the loser died the winner took hold of the nearest woman not even the one they had been quarreling over and had her there and then slaves carried off the body and the dancing resumed magister illyrio had warned dany about this too a dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is deemed a dull affair he had said her wedding must have been especially blessed before the day was over a dozen men had died as the hours passed the terror grew in dany until it was all she could do not to scream she was afraid of the dothraki whose ways seemed alien and monstrous as if they were beasts in human skins and not true men at all she was afraid of her brother of what he might do if she failed him most of all she was afraid of what would happen tonight under the stars when her brother gave her up to the hulking giant who sat drinking beside her with a face as still and cruel as a bronze mask i am the blood of the dragon she told herself again when at last the sun was low in the sky khal drogo clapped his hands together and the drums and the shouting and feasting came to a sudden halt drogo stood and pulled dany to her feet beside him it was time for her bride gifts and after the gifts she knew after the sun had gone down it would be time for the first ride and the consummation of her marriage dany tried to put the thought aside but it would not leave her she hugged herself to try to keep from shaking her brother viserys gifted her with three handmaids dany knew they had cost him nothing illyrio no doubt had provided the girls irri and jhiqui were copper skinned dothraki with black hair and almondshaped eyes doreah a fair haired blue eyed lysene girl these are no common servants sweet sister her brother told her as they were brought forward one by one illyrio and i selected them personally for you irri will teach you riding jhiqui the dothraki tongue and doreah will instruct you in the womanly arts of love he smiled thinly shes very good illyrio and i can both swear to that ser jorah mormont apologized for his gift it is a small thing my princess but all a poor exile could afford he said as he laid a small stack of old books before her they were histories and songs of the seven kingdoms she saw written in the common tongue she thanked him with all her heart magister illyrio murmured a command and four burly slaves hurried forward bearing between them a great cedar chest bound in bronze when she opened it she found piles of the finest velvets and damasks the free cities could produce and resting on top nestled in the soft cloth three huge eggs dany gasped they were the most beautiful things she had ever seen each different than the others patterned in such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels and so large it took both of her hands to hold one she lifted it delicately expecting that it would be made of some fine porcelain or delicate enamel or even blown glass but it was much heavier than that as if it were all of solid stone the surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales and as she turned the egg between her fingers they shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun one egg was a deep green with burnished bronze flecks that came and went depending on how dany turned it another was pale cream streaked with gold the last was black as black as a midnight sea yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls what are they she asked her voice hushed and full of wonder dragons eggs from the shadow lands beyond asshai said magister illyrio the eons have turned them to stone yet still they burn bright with beauty i shall treasure them always dany had heard tales of such eggs but she had never seen one nor thought to see one it was a truly magnificent gift though she knew that illyrio could afford to be lavish he had collected a fortune in horses and slaves for his part in selling her to khal drogo the khals bloodriders offered her the traditional three weapons and splendid weapons they were haggo gave her a great leather whip with a silver handle cohollo a magnificent arakh chased in gold and qotho a double curved dragonbone bow taller than she was magister illyrio and ser jorah had taught her the traditional refusals for these offerings this is a gift worthy of a great warrior blood of my blood and i am but a woman let my lord husband bear these in my stead and so khal drogo too received his bride gifts other gifts she was given in plenty by other dothraki slippers and jewels and silver rings for her hair medallion belts and painted vests and soft furs sandsilks and jars of scent needles and feathers and tiny bottles of purple glass and a gown made from the skin of a thousand mice a handsome gift khaleesi magister illyrio said of the last after he had told her what it was most lucky the gifts mounted up around her in great piles more gifts than she could possibly imagine more gifts than she could want or use and last of all khal drogo brought forth his own bride gift to her an expectant hush rippled out from the center of the camp as he left her side growing until it had swallowed the whole khalasar when he returned the dense press of dothraki gift givers parted before him and he led the horse to her she was a young filly spirited and splendid dany knew just enough about horses to know that this was no ordinary animal there was something about her that took the breath away she was grey as the winter sea with a mane like silver smoke hesitantly she reached out and stroked the horses neck ran her fingers through the silver of her mane khal drogo said something in dothraki and magister illyrio translated silver for the silver of your hair the khal says shes beautiful dany murmured she is the pride of the khalasar illyrio said custom decrees that the khaleesi must ride a mount worthy of her place by the side of the khal drogo stepped forward and put his hands on her waist he lifted her up as easily as if she were a child and set her on the thin dothraki saddle so much smaller than the ones she was used to dany sat there uncertain for a moment no one had told her about this part what should i do she asked illyrio it was ser jorah mormont who answered take the reins and ride you need not go far nervously dany gathered the reins in her hands and slid her feet into the short stirrups she was only a fair rider she had spent far more time traveling by ship and wagon and palanquin than by horseback praying that she would not fall off and disgrace herself she gave the filly the lightest and most timid touch with her knees and for the first time in hours she forgot to be afraid or perhaps it was for the first time ever the silver grey filly moved with a smooth and silken gait and the crowd parted for her every eye upon them dany found herself moving faster than she had intended yet somehow it was exciting rather than terrifying the horse broke into a trot and she smiled dothraki scrambled to clear a path the slightest pressure with her legs the lightest touch on the reins and the filly responded she sent it into a gallop and now the dothraki were hooting and laughing and shouting at her as they jumped out of her way as she turned to ride back a firepit loomed ahead directly in her path they were hemmed in on either side with no room to stop a daring she had never known filled daenerys then and she gave the filly her head the silver horse leapt the flames as if she had wings when she pulled up before magister illyrio she said tell khal drogo that he has given me the wind the fat pentoshi stroked his yellow beard as he repeated her words in dothraki and dany saw her new husband smile for the first time the last sliver of sun vanished behind the high walls of pentos to the west just then dany had lost all track of time khal drogo commanded his bloodriders to bring forth his own horse a lean red stallion as the khal was saddling the horse viserys slid close to dany on her silver dug his fingers into her leg and said please him sweet sister or i swear you will see the dragon wake as it has never woken before the fear came back to her then with her brothers words she felt like a child once more only thirteen and all alone not ready for what was about to happen to her they rode out together as the stars came out leaving the khalasar and the grass palaces behind khal drogo spoke no word to her but drove his stallion at a hard trot through the gathering dusk the tiny silver bells in his long braid rang softly as he rode i am the blood of the dragon she whispered aloud as she followed trying to keep her courage up i am the blood of the dragon i am the blood of the dragon the dragon was never afraid afterward she could not say how far or how long they had ridden but it was full dark when they stopped at a grassy place beside a small stream drogo swung off his horse and lifted her down from hers she felt as fragile as glass in his hands her limbs as weak as water she stood there helpless and trembling in her wedding silks while he secured the horses and when he turned to look at her she began to cry khal drogo stared at her tears his face strangely empty of expression no he said he lifted his hand and rubbed away the tears roughly with a callused thumb you speak the common tongue dany said in wonder no he said again perhaps he had only that word she thought but it was one word more than she had known he had and somehow it made her feel a little better drogo touched her hair lightly sliding the silver blond strands between his fingers and murmuring softly in dothraki dany did not understand the words yet there was warmth in the tone a tenderness she had never expected from this man he put his finger under her chin and lifted her head so she was looking up into his eyes drogo towered over her as he towered over everyone taking her lightly under the arms he lifted her and seated her on a rounded rock beside the stream then he sat on the ground facing her legs crossed beneath him their faces finally at a height no he said is that the only word you know she asked him drogo did not reply his long heavy braid was coiled in the dirt beside him he pulled it over his right shoulder and began to remove the bells from his hair one by one after a moment dany leaned forward to help when they were done drogo gestured she understood slowly carefully she began to undo his braid it took a long time all the while he sat there silently watching her when she was done he shook his head and his hair spread out behind him like a river of darkness oiled and gleaming she had never seen hair so long so black so thick then it was his turn he began to undress her his fingers were deft and strangely tender he removed her silks one by one carefully while dany sat unmoving silent looking at his eyes when he bared her small breasts she could not help herself she averted her eyes and covered herself with her hands no drogo said he pulled her hands away from her breasts gently but firmly then lifted her face again to make her look at him no he repeated no she echoed back at him he stood her up then and pulled her close to remove the last of her silks the night air was chilly on her bare skin she shivered and gooseflesh covered her arms and legs she was afraid of what would come next but for a while nothing happened khal drogo sat with his legs crossed looking at her drinking in her body with his eyes after a while he began to touch her lightly at first then harder she could sense the fierce strength in his hands but he never hurt her he held her hand in his own and brushed her fingers one by one he ran a hand gently down her leg he stroked her face tracing the curve of her ears running a finger gently around her mouth he put both hands in her hair and combed it with his fingers he turned her around massaged her shoulders slid a knuckle down the path of her spine it seemed as if hours passed before his hands finally went to her breasts he stroked the soft skin underneath until it tingled he circled her nipples with his thumbs pinched them between thumb and forefinger then began to pull at her very lightly at first then more insistently until her nipples stiffened and began to ache he stopped then and drew her down onto his lap dany was flushed and breathless her heart fluttering in her chest he cupped her face in his huge hands and looked into his eyes no he said and she knew it was a question she took his hand and moved it down to the wetness between her thighs yes she whispered as she put his finger inside her eddard the summons came in the hour before the dawn when the world was still and grey alyn shook him roughly from his dreams and ned stumbled into the predawn chill groggy from sleep to find his horse saddled and the king already mounted robert wore thick brown gloves and a heavy fur cloak with a hood that covered his ears and looked for all the world like a bear sitting a horse up stark he roared up up we have matters of state to discuss by all means ned said come inside your grace alyn lifted the flap of the tent no no no robert said his breath steamed with every word the camp is full of ears besides i want to ride out and taste this country of yours ser boros and ser meryn waited behind him with a dozen guardsmen ned saw there was nothing to do but rub the sleep from his eyes dress and mount up robert set the pace driving his huge black destrier hard as ned galloped along beside him trying to keep up he called out a question as they rode but the wind blew his words away and the king did not hear him after that ned rode in silence they soon left the kingsroad and took off across rolling plains dark with mist by then the guard had fallen back a small distance safely out of earshot but still robert would not slow dawn broke as they crested a low ridge and finally the king pulled up by then they were miles south of the main party robert was flushed and exhilarated as ned reined up beside him gods he swore laughing it feels good to get out and tide the way a man was meant to ride i swear ned this creeping along is enough to drive a man mad he had never been a patient man robert baratheon that damnable wheelhouse the way it creaks and groans climbing every bump in the road as if it were a mountain i promise you if that wretched thing breaks another axle im going to burn it and cersei can walk ned laughed i will gladly light the torch for you good man the king clapped him on the shoulder ive half a mind to leave them all behind and just keep going a smile touched neds lips i do believe you mean it i do i do the king said what do you say ned just you and me two vagabond knights on the kingsroad our swords at our sides and the gods know what in front of us and maybe a farmers daughter or a tavern wench to warm our beds tonight would that we could ned said but we have duties now my liege to the realm to our children i to my lady wife and you to your queen we are not the boys we were you were never the boy you were robert grumbled mores the pity and yet there was that one time what was her name that common girl of yours becca no she was one of mine gods love her black hair and these sweet big eyes you could drown in them yours was aleena no you told me once was it merryl you know the one i mean your bastards mother her name was wylla ned replied with cool courtesy and i would sooner not speak of her wylla yes the king grinned she must have been a rare wench if she could make lord eddard stark forget his honor even for an hour you never told me what she looked like neds mouth tightened in anger nor will leave it be robert for the love you say you bear me i dishonored myself and i dishonored catelyn in the sight of gods and men gods have mercy you scarcely knew catelyn i had taken her to wife she was carrying my child you are too hard on yourself ned you always were damn it no woman wants baelor the blessed in her bed he slapped a hand on his knee well ill not press you if you feel so strong about it though i swear at times youre so prickly you ought to take the hedgehog as your sigil the rising sun sent fingers of light through the pale white mists of dawn a wide plain spread out beneath them bare and brown its flatness here and there relieved by long low hummocks ned pointed them out to his king the barrows of the first men robert frowned have we ridden onto a graveyard there are barrows everywhere in the north your grace ned told him this land is old and cold robert grumbled pulling his cloak more tightly around himself the guard had reined up well behind them at the bottom of the ridge well i did not bring you out here to talk of graves or bicker about your bastard there was a rider in the night from lord varys in kings landing here the king pulled a paper from his belt and handed it to ned varys the eunuch was the kings master of whisperers he served robert now as he had once served aerys targaryen ned unrolled the paper with trepidation thinking of lysa and her terrible accusation but the message did not concern lady arryn what is the source for this information do you remember ser jorah mormont would that i might forget him ned said bluntly the mormonts of bear island were an old house proud and honorable but their lands were cold and distant and poor ser jorah had tried to swell the family coffers by selling some poachers to a tyroshi slaver as the mormonts were bannermen to the starks his crime had dishonored the north ned had made the long journey west to bear island only to find when he arrived that jorah had taken ship beyond the reach of ice and the kings justice five years had passed since then ser jorah is now in pentos anxious to earn a royal pardon that would allow him to return from exile robert explained lord varys makes good use of him so the slaver has become a spy ned said with distaste he handed the letter back i would rather he become a corpse varys tells me that spies are more useful than corpses robert said jorah aside what do you make of his report daenerys targaryen has wed some dothraki horselord what of it shall we send her a wedding gift the king frowned a knife perhaps a good sharp one and a bold man to wield it ned did not feign surprise roberts hatred of the targaryens was a madness in him he remembered the angry words they had exchanged when tywin lannister had presented robert with the corpses of rhaegars wife and children as a token of fealty ned had named that glorge r r martin murder robert called it war when he had protested that the young prince and princess were no more than babes his new made king had replied i see no babes only dragonspawn not even jon arryn had been able to calm that storm eddard stark had ridden out that very day in a cold rage to fight the last battles of the war alone in the south it had taken another death to reconcile them lyannas death and the grief they had shared over her passing this time ned resolved to keep his temper your grace the girl is scarcely more than a child you are no tywin lannister to slaughter innocents it was said that rhaegars little girl had cried as they dragged her from beneath her bed to face the swords the boy had been no more than a babe in arms yet lord tywins soldiers had torn him from his mothers breast and dashed his head against a wall and how long will this one remain an innocent roberts mouth grew hard this child will soon enough spread her legs and start breeding more dragonspawn to plague me nonetheless ned said the murder of children it would be vile unspeakable unspeakable the king roared what aerys did to your brother brandon was unspeakable the way your lord father died that was unspeakable and rhaegar how many times do you think he raped your sister how many hundreds of times his voice had grown so loud that his horse whinnied nervously beneath him the king jerked the reins hard quieting the animal and pointed an angry finger at ned i will kill every targaryen i can get my hands on until they are as dead as their dragons and then i will piss on their graves ned knew better than to defy him when the wrath was on him if the years had not quenched roberts thirst for revenge no words of his would help you cant get your hands on this one can you he said quietly the kings mouth twisted in a bitter grimace no gods be cursed some pox ridden pentoshi cheesemonger had her brother and her walled up on his estate with pointy hatted eunuchs all around them and now hes handed them over to the dothraki i should have had them both killed years ago when it was easy to get at them but jon was as bad as you more fool listened to him jon arryn was a wise man and a good hand robert snorted the anger was leaving him as suddenly as it had come this khal drogo is said to have a hundred thousand men in his horde what would jon say to that he would say that even a million dothraki are no threat to the realm so long as they remain on the other side of the narrow sea ned replied calmly the barbarians have no ships they hate and fear the open sea the king shifted uncomfortably in his saddle perhaps there are ships to be had in the free cities though i tell you ned i do not like this marriage there are still those in the seven kingdoms who call me usurper do you forget how many houses fought for targaryen in the war they bide their time for now but give them half a chance they will murder me in my bed and my sons with me if the beggar king crosses with a dothraki horde at his back the traitors will join him he will not cross ned promised and if by some mischance he does we will throw him back into the sea once you choose a new warden of the east the king groaned for the last time i will not name the arryn boy warden i know the boy is your nephew but with targaryens climbing in bed with dothraki i would be mad to rest one quarter of the realm on the shoulders of a sickly child ned was ready for that yet we still must have a warden of the east if robert arryn will not do name one of your brothers stannis proved himself at the siege of storms end surely he let the name hang there for a moment the king frowned and said nothing he looked uncomfortable that is ned finished quietly watching unless you have already promised the honor to another for a moment robert had the grace to look startled just as quickly the look became annoyance what if i have its jaime lannister is it not robert kicked his horse back into motion and started down the ridge toward the barrows ned kept pace with him the king rode on eyes straight ahead yes he said at last a single hard word to end the matter kingslayer ned said the rumors were true then he rode on dangerous ground now he knew an able and courageous man no doubt he said carefully but his father is warden of the west robert in time ser jaime will succeed to that honor no one man should hold both east and west he left unsaid his real concern that the appointment would put half the armies of the realm into the hands of lannisters i will fight that battle when the enemy appears on the field the king said stubbornly at the moment lord tywin looms eternal as casterly rock so i doubt that jaime will be succeeding anytime soon dont vex me about this ned the stone has been set your grace may i speak frankly i seem unable to stop you robert grumbled they rode through tall brown grasses can you trust jaime lannister he is my wifes twin a sworn brother of the kingsguard his life and fortune and honor all bound to mine as they were bound to aerys targaryens ned pointed out why should i mistrust him he has done everything i have ever asked of him his sword helped win the throne i sit on his sword helped taint the throne you sit on ned thought but he did not permit the words to pass his lips he swore a vow to protect his kings life with his own then he opened that kings throat with a sword seven hells someone had to kill aerys robert said reining his mount to a sudden halt beside an ancient barrow if jaime hadnt done it it would have been left for you or me we were not sworn brothers of the kingsguard ned said the time had come for robert to hear the whole truth he decided then and there do you remember the trident your grace i won my crown there how should i forget it you took a wound from rhaegar ned reminded him so when the targaryen host broke and ran you gave the pursuit into my hands the remnants of rhaegars army fled back to kings landing we followed aerys was in the red keep with several thousand loyalists i expected to find the gates closed to us robert gave an impatient shake of his head instead you found that our men had already taken the city what of it not our men ned said patiently lannister men the lion of lannister flew over the ramparts not the crowned stag and they had taken the city by treachery the war had raged for close to a year lords great and small had flocked to roberts banners others had remained loyal to targaryen the mighty lannisters of casterly rock the wardens of the west had remained aloof from the struggle ignoring calls to arms from both rebels and royalists aerys targaryen must have thought that his gods had answered his prayers when lord tywin lannister appeared before the gates of kings landing with an army twelve thousand strong professing loyalty so the mad king had ordered his last mad act he had opened his city to the lions at the gate treachery was a coin the targaryens knew well robert said the anger was building in him again lannister paid them back in kind it was no less than they deserved i shall not trouble my sleep over it you were not there ned said bitterness in his voice troubled sleep was no stranger to him he had lived his lies for fourteen years yet they still haunted him at night there was no honor in that conquest the others take your honor robert swore what did any targaryen ever know of honor go down into your crypt and ask lyanna about the dragons honor you avenged lyanna at the trident ned said halting beside the king promise me ned she had whispered that did not bring her back robert looked away off into the grey distance the gods be damned it was a hollow victory they gave me a crown it was the girl i prayed them for your sister safe and mine again as she was meant to be i ask you ned what good is it to wear a crown the gods mock the prayers of kings and cowherds alike i cannot answer for the gods your grace only for what i found when i rode into the throne room that day ned said aerys was dead on the floor drowned in his own blood his dragon skulls stared down from the walls lannisters men were everywhere jaime wore the white cloak of the kingsguard over his golden armor i can see him still even his sword was gilded he was seated on the iron throne high above his knights wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lions head how he glittered this is well known the king complained i was still mounted i rode the length of the hall in silence between the long rows of dragon skulls it felt as though they were watching me somehow i stopped in front of the throne looking up at him his golden sword was across his legs its edge red with a kings blood my men were filling the room behind me lannisters men drew back i never said a word i looked at him seated there on the throne and i waited at last jaime laughed and got up he took off his helm and he said to me have no fear stark i was only keeping it warm for our friend robert its not a very comfortable seat im afraid the king threw back his head and roared his laughter startled a flight of crows from the tall brown grass they took to the air in a wild beating of wings you think i should mistrust lannister because he sat on my throne for a few moments he shook with laughter again jaime was all of seventeen ned scarce more than a boy boy or man he had no right to that throne perhaps he was tired robert suggested killing kings is weary work gods know theres no place else to rest your ass in that damnable room and he spoke truly it is a monstrous uncomfortable chair in more ways than one the king shook his head well now i know jaimes dark sin and the matter can be forgotten i am heartily sick of secrets and squabbles and matters of state ned its all as tedious as counting coppers come lets ride you used to know how i want to feel the wind in my hair again he kicked his horse back into motion and galloped up over the barrow raining earth down behind him for a moment ned did not follow he had run out of words and he was filled with a vast sense of helplessness not for the first time he wondered what he was doing here and why he had come he was no jon arryn to curb the wildness of his king and teach him wisdom robert would do what he pleased as he always had and nothing ned could say or do would change that he belonged in winterfell he belonged with catelyn in her grief and with bran a man could not always be where he belonged though resigned eddard stark put his boots into his horse and set off after the king tyrion the north went on forever tyrion lannister knew the maps as well as anyone but a fortnight on the wild track that passed for the kingsroad up here had brought home the lesson that the map was one thing and the land quite another they had left winterfell on the same day as the king amidst all the commotion of the royal departure riding out to the sound of men shouting and horses snorting to the rattle of wagons and the groaning of the queens huge wheelhouse as a light snow flurried about them the kingsroad was just beyond the sprawl of castle and town there the banners and the wagons and the columns of knights and freeriders turned south taking the tumult with them while tyrion turned north with benjen stark and his nephew it had grown colder after that and far more quiet west of the road were flint hills grey and rugged with tall watchtowers on their stony summits to the east the land was lower the ground flattening to a rolling plain that stretched away as far as the eye could see stone bridges spanned swift narrow rivers while small farms spread in rings around holdfasts walled in wood and stone the road was well trafficked and at night for their comfort there were rude inns to be found three days ride from winterfell however the farmland gave way to dense wood and the kingsroad grew lonely the flint hills rose higher and wilder with each passing mile until by the fifth day they had turned into mountains cold blue grey giants with jagged promontories and snow on their shoulders when the wind blew from the north long plumes of ice crystals flew from the high peaks like banners with the mountains a wall to the west the road veered north by northeast through the wood a forest of oak and evergreen and black brier that seemed older and darker than any tyrion had ever seen the wolfswood benjen stark called it and indeed their nights came alive with the howls of distant packs and some not so distant jon snows albino direwolf pricked up his ears at the nightly howling but never raised his own voice in reply there was something very unsettling about that animal tyrion thought there were eight in the party by then not counting the wolf tyrion traveled with two of his own men as befit a lannister benjen stark had only his bastard nephew and some fresh mounts for the nights watch but at the edge of the wolfswood they stayed a night behind the wooden walls of a forest holdfast and there joined up with another of the black brothers one yoren yoren was stooped and sinister his features hidden behind a beard as black as his clothing but he seemed as tough as an old root and as hard as stone with him were a pair of ragged peasant boys from the fingers rapers yoren said with a cold look at his charges tyrion understood life on the wall was said to be hard but no doubt it was preferable to castration five men three boys a direwolf twenty horses and a cage of ravens given over to benjen stark by maester luwin no doubt they made a curious fellowship for the kingsroad or any road tyrion noticed jon snow watching yoren and his sullen companions with an odd cast to his face that looked uncomfortably like dismay yoren had a twisted shoulder and a sour smell his hair and beard were matted and greasy and full of lice his clothing old patched and seldom washed his two young recruits smelled even worse and seemed as stupid as they were cruel no doubt the boy had made the mistake of thinking that the nights watch was made up of men like his uncle if so yoren and his companions were a rude awakening tyrion felt sorry for the boy he had chosen a hard life or perhaps he should say that a hard life had been chosen for him he had rather less sympathy for the uncle benjen stark seemed to share his brothers distaste for lannisters and he had not been pleased when tyrion had told him of his intentions i warn you lannister youll find no inns at the wall he had said looking down on him no doubt youll find some place to put me tyrion had replied as you might have noticed im small one did not say no to the queens brother of course so that had settled the matter but stark had not been happy you will not like the ride i promise you that hed said curtly and since the moment they set out he had done all he could to live up to that promise by the end of the first week tyrions thighs were raw from hard riding his legs were cramping badly and he was chilled to the bone he did not complain he was damned if he would give benjen stark that satisfaction he took a small revenge in the matter of his riding fur a tattered bearskin old and musty smelling stark had offered it to him in an excess of nights watch gallantry no doubt expecting him to graciously decline tyrion had accepted with a smile he had brought his warmest clothing with him when they rode out of winterfell and soon discovered that it was nowhere near warm enough it was cold up here and growing colder the nights were well below freezing now and when the wind blew it was like a knife cutting right through his warmest woolens by now stark was no doubt regretting his chivalrous impulse perhaps he had learned a lesson the lannisters never declined graciously or otherwise the lannisters took what was offered farms and holdfasts grew scarcer and smaller as they pressed northward ever deeper into the darkness of the wolfswood until finally there were no more roofs to shelter under and they were thrown back on their own resources tyrion was never much use in making a camp or breaking one too small too hobbled too in the way so while stark and yoren and the other men erected rude shelters tended the horses and built a fire it became his custom to take his fur and a wineskin and go off by himself to read on the eighteenth night of their journey the wine was a rare sweet amber from the summer isles that he had brought all the way north from casterly rock and the book a rumination on the history and properties of dragons with lord eddard starks permission tyrion had borrowed a few rare volumes from the winterfell library and packed them for the ride north he found a comfortable spot just beyond the noise of the camp beside a swift running stream with waters clear and cold as ice a grotesquely ancient oak provided shelter from the biting wind tyrion curled up in his fur with his back against the trunk took a sip of the wine and began to read about the properties of dragonbone dragonbone is black because of its high iron content the book told him it is strong as steel yet lighter and far more flexible and of course utterly impervious to fire dragonbone bows are greatly prized by the dothraki and small wonder an archer so armed can outrange any wooden bow tyrion had a morbid fascination with dragons when he had first come to kings landing for his sisters wedding to robert baratheon he had made it a point to seek out the dragon skulls that had hung on the walls of targaryens throne room king robert had replaced them with banners and tapestries but tyrion had persisted until he found the skulls in the dank cellar where they had been stored he had expected to find them impressive perhaps even frightening he had not thought to find them beautiful yet they were as black as onyx polished smooth so the bone seemed to shimmer in the light of his torch they liked the fire he sensed hed thrust the torch into the mouth of one of the larger skulls and made the shadows leap and dance on the wall behind him the teeth were long curving knives of black diamond the flame of the torch was nothing to them they had bathed in the heat of far greater fires when he had moved away tyrion could have sworn that the beasts empty eye sockets had watched him go there were nineteen skulls the oldest was more than three thousand years old the youngest a mere century and a half the most recent were also the smallest a matched pair no bigger than mastiffs skulls and oddly misshapen all that remained of the last two hatchlings born on dragonstone they were the last of the targaryen dragons perhaps the last dragons anywhere and they had not lived very long from there the skulls ranged upward in size to the three great monsters of song and story the dragons that aegon targaryen and his sisters had unleashed on the seven kingdoms of old the singers had given them the names of gods balerion meraxes vhaghar tyrion had stood between their gaping jaws wordless and awed you could have ridden a horse down vhaghars gullet although you would not have ridden it out again meraxes was even bigger and the greatest of them balerion the black dread could have swallowed an aurochs whole or even one of the hairy mammoths said to roam the cold wastes beyond the port of ibben tyrion stood in that dank cellar for a long time staring at balerions huge empty eyed skull until his torch burned low trying to grasp the size of the living animal to imagine how it must have looked when it spread its great black wings and swept across the skies breathing fire a gaml of thrones his own remote ancestor king loren of the rock had tried to stand against the fire when he joined with king mern of the reach to oppose the targaryen conquest that was close on three hundred years ago when the seven kingdoms were kingdoms and not mere provinces of a greater realm between them the two kings had six hundred banners flying five thousand mounted knights and ten times as many freeriders and men at arms aegon dragonlord had perhaps a fifth that number the chroniclers said and most of those were conscripts from the ranks of the last king he had slain their loyalties uncertain the hosts met on the broad plains of the reach amidst golden fields of wheat ripe for harvest when the two kings charged the targaryen army shivered and shattered and began to run for a few moments the chroniclers wrote the conquest was at an end but only for those few moments before aegon targaryen and his sisters joined the battle it was the only time that vhaghar meraxes and balerion were all unleashed at once the singers called it the field of fire near four thousand men had burned that day among them king mern of the reach king loren had escaped and lived long enough to surrender pledge his fealty to the targaryens and beget a son for which tyrion was duly grateful why do you read so much tyrion looked up at the sound of the voice jon snow was standing a few feet away regarding him curiously he closed the book on a finger and said look at me and tell me what you see the boy looked at him suspiciously is this some kind of trick i see you tyrion lannister tyrion sighed you are remarkably polite for a bastard snow what you see is a dwarf you are what twelve fourteen the boy said fourteen and youre taller than i will ever be my legs are short and twisted and i walk with difficulty i require a special saddle to keep from falling off my horse a saddle of my own design you may be interested to know it was either that or ride a pony my arms are strong enough but again too short i will never make a swordsman had i been born a peasant they might have left me out to die or sold me to some slavers grotesquerie alas i was born a lannister of casterly rock and the grotesqueries are all the poorer things are expected of me my father was the hand of the king for twenty years my brother later killed that very same king as it turns out but life is full of these little ironies my sister married the new king and my repulsive nephew will be king after him i must do my part for the honor of my house wouldnt you agree yet how well my legs may be too small for my body but my head is too large although i prefer to think it is just large enough for my mind i have a realistic grasp of my own strengths and weaknesses my mind is my weapon my brother has his sword king robert has his warhammer and i have my mind and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone if it is to keep its edge tyrion tapped the leather cover of the book thats why i read so much jon snow the boy absorbed that all in silence he had the stark face if not the name long solemn guarded a face that gave nothing away whoever his mother had been she had left little of herself in her son what are you reading about he asked dragons tyrion told him what good is that there are no more dragons the boy said with the easy certainty of youth so they say tyrion replied sad isnt it when i was your age used to dream of having a dragon of my own you did the boy said suspiciously perhaps he thought tyrion was making fun of him oh yes even a stunted twisted ugly little boy can look down over the world when hes seated on a dragons back tyrion pushed the bearskin aside and climbed to his feet i used to start fires in the bowels of casterly rock and stare at the flames for hours pretending they were dragonfire sometimes id imagine my father burning at other times my sister jon snow was staring at him a look equal parts horror and fascination tyrion guffawed dont look at me that way bastard i know your secret youve dreamt the same kind of dreams no jon snow said horrified i wouldnt no never tyrion raised an eyebrow well no doubt the starks have been terribly good to you im certain lady stark treats you as if you were one of her own and your brother robb hes always been kind and why not he gets winterfell and you get the wall and your father he must have good reasons for packing you off to the nights watch stop it jon snow said his face dark with anger the nights watch is a noble calling tyrion laughed youre too smart to believe that the nights watch is a midden heap for all the misfits of the realm ive seen you looking at yoren and his boys those are your new brothers jon snow how do you like them sullen peasants debtors poachers rapers thieves and bastards like you all wind up on the wall watching for grumkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about the good part is there are no grumkins or snarks so its scarcely dangerous work the bad part is you freeze your balls off but since youre not allowed to breed anyway i dont suppose that matters stop it the boy screamed he took a step forward his hands coiling into fists close to tears suddenly absurdly tyrion felt guilty he took a step forward intending to give the boy a reassuring pat on the shoulder or mutter some word of apology he never saw the wolf where it was or how it came at him one moment he was walking toward snow and the next he was flat on his back on the hard rocky ground the book spinning away from him as he fell the breath going out of him at the sudden impact his mouth full of dirt and blood and rotting leaves as he tried to get up his back spasmed painfully he must have wrenched it in the fall he ground his teeth in frustration grabbed a root and pulled himself back to a sitting position help me he said to the boy reaching up a hand and suddenly the wolf was between them he did not growl the damned thing never made a sound he only looked at him with those bright red eyes and showed him his teeth and that was more than enough tyrion sagged back to the ground with a grunt dont help me then ill sit right here until you leave jon snow stroked ghosts thick white fur smiling now ask me nicely tyrion lannister felt the anger coiling inside him and crushed it out with a will it was not the first time in his life he had been humiliated and it would not be the last perhaps he even deserved this i should be very grateful for your kind assistance jon he said mildly down ghost the boy said the direwolf sat on his haunches those red eyes never left tyrion jon came around behind him slid his hands under his arms and lifted him easily to his feet then he picked up the book and handed it back why did he attack me tyrion asked with a sidelong glance at the direwolf he wiped blood and dirt from his mouth with the back of his hand maybe he thought you were a grumkin tyrion glanced at him sharply then he laughed a raw snort of amusement that came bursting out through his nose entirely without his permission oh gods he said choking on his laughter and shaking his head i suppose i do rather look like a grumkin what does he do to snarks you dont want to know jon picked up the wineskin and handed it to tyrion tyrion pulled out the stopper tilted his head and squeezed a long stream into his mouth the wine was cool fire as it trickled down his throat and warmed his belly he held out the skin to jon snow want some the boy took the skin and tried a cautious swallow its true isnt it he said when he was done what you said about the nights watch tyrion nodded jon snow set his mouth in a grim line if thats what it is thats what it is tyrion grinned at him thats good bastard most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it most men the boy said but not you no tyrion admitted not me i seldom even dream of dragons anymore there are no dragons he scooped up the fallen bearskin come we had better return to camp before your uncle calls the banners the walk was short but the ground was rough underfoot and his legs were cramping badly by the time they got back jon snow offered a hand to help him over a thick tangle of roots but tyrion shook him off he would make his own way as he had all his life still the camp was a welcome sight the shelters had been thrown up against the tumbledown wall of a long abandoned holdfast a shield against the wind the horses had been fed and a fire had been laid yoren sat on a stone skinning a squirrel the savory smell of stew filled tyrions nostrils he dragged himself over to where his man morrec was tending the stewpot wordlessly morrec handed him the ladle tyrion tasted and handed it back more pepper he said benjen stark emerged from the shelter he shared with his nephew there you are jon damn it dont go off like that by yourself i thought the others had gotten you it was the grumkins tyrion told him laughing jon snow smiled stark shot a baffled look at yoren the old man grunted shrugged and went back to his bloody work the squirrel gave some body to the stew and they ate it with black bread and hard cheese that night around their fire tyrion shared around his skin of wine until even yoren grew mellow one by one the company drifted off to their shelters and to sleep all but jon snow who had drawn the nights first watch tyrion was the last to retire as always as he stepped into the shelter his men had built for him he paused and looked back at jon snow the boy stood near the fire his face still and hard looking deep into the flames tyrion lannister smiled sadly and went to bed catelyn ned and the girls were eight days gone when maester luwin came to her one night in brans sickroom carrying a reading lamp and the books of account it is past time that we reviewed the figures my lady he said youll want to know how much this royal visit cost us catelyn looked at bran in his sickbed and brushed his hair back off his forehead it had grown very long she realized she would have to cut it soon i have no need to look at figures maester luwin she told him never taking her eyes from bran i know what the visit cost us take the books away my lady the kings party had healthy appetites we must replenish our stores before she cut him off i said take the books away the steward will attend to our needs we have no steward maester luwin reminded her like a little grey rat she thought he would not let go poole went south to establish lord eddards household at kings landing catelyn nodded absently oh yes i remember bran looked so pale she wondered whether they might move his bed under the window so he could get the morning sun maester luwin set the lamp in a niche by the door and fiddled with its wick there are several appointments that require your immediate attention my lady besides the steward we need a captain of the guards to fill jorys place a new master of horse her eyes snapped around and found him a master of horse her voice was a whip the maester was shaken yes my lady hullen rode south with lord eddard so my son lies here broken and dying luwin and you wish to discuss a new master of horse do you think i care what happens in the stables do you think it matters to me one whit i would gladly butcher every horse in winterfell with my own hands if it would open brans eyes do you understand that do you he bowed his head yes my lady but the appointments ill make the appointments robb said catelyn had not heard him enter but there he stood in the doorway looking at her she had been shouting she realized with a sudden flush of shame what was happening to her she was so tired and her head hurt all the time maester luwin looked from catelyn to her son i have prepared a list of those we might wish to consider for the vacant offices he said offering robb a paper plucked from his sleeve her son glanced at the names he had come from outside catelyn saw his cheeks were red from the cold his hair shaggy and windblown good men he said well talk about them tomorrow he handed back the list of names very good my lord the paper vanished into his sleeve leave us now robb said maester luwin bowed and departed robb closed the door behind him and turned to her he was wearing a sword she saw mother what are you doing catelyn had always thought robb looked like her like bran and rickon and sansa he had the tully coloring the auburn hair the blue eyes yet now for the first time she saw something of eddard stark in his face something as stern and hard as the north what am i doing she echoed puzzled how can you ask that what do you imagine im doing i am taking care of your brother i am taking care of bran is that what you call it you havent left this room since bran was hurt you didnt even come to the gate when father and the girls went south i said my farewells to them here and watched them ride out from that window she had begged ned not to go not now not after what had happened everything had changed now couldnt he see that it was no use he had no choice he had told her and then he left choosing i cant leave him even for a moment not when any moment could be his last i have to be with him if if she took her sons limp hand sliding his fingers through her own he was so frail and thin with no strength left in his hand but she could still feel the warmth of life through his skin robbs voice softened hes not going to die mother maester luwin says the time of greatest danger has passed and what if maester luwin is wrong what if bran needs me and im not here rickon needs you robb said sharply hes only three he doesnt understand whats happening he thinks everyone has deserted him so he follows me around all day clutching my leg and crying i dont know what to do with him he paused a moment chewing on his lower lip the way hed done when he was little mother i need you too im trying but i cant i cant do it all by myself his voice broke with sudden emotion and catelyn remembered that he was only fourteen she wanted to get up and go to him but bran was still holding her hand and she could not move outside the tower a wolf began to howl catelyn trembled just for a second brans robb opened the window and let the night air into the stuffy tower room the howling grew louder it was a cold and lonely sound full of melancholy and despair dont she told him bran needs to stay warm he needs to hear them sing robb said somewhere out in winterfell a second wolf began to howl in chorus with the first then a third closer shaggydog and grey wind robb said as their voices rose and fell together you can tell them apart if you listen close catelyn was shaking it was the grief the cold the howling of the direwolves night after night the howling and the cold wind and the grey empty castle on and on they went never changing and her boy lying there broken the sweetest of her children the gentlest bran who loved to laugh and climb and dreamt of knighthood all gone now she would never hear him laugh again sobbing she pulled her hand free of his and covered her ears against those terrible howls make them stop she cried i cant stand it make them stop make them stop kill them all if you must just make them stop she didnt remember falling to the floor but there she was and robb was lifting her holding her in strong arms dont be afraid mother they would never hurt him he helped her to her narrow bed in the corner of the sickroom close your eyes he said gently rest maester luwin tells me youve hardly slept since brans fall i cant she wept gods forgive me robb i cant what if he dies while im asleep what if he dies what if he dies the wolves were still howling she screamed and held her ears again oh gods close the window if you swear to me youll sleep robb went to the window but as he reached for the shutters another sound was added to the mournful howling of the direwolves dogs he said listening all the dogs are barking theyve never done that before catelyn heard his breath catch in his throat when she looked up his face was pale in the lamplight fire he whispered fire she thought and then bran help me she said urgently sitting up help me with bran robb did not seem to hear her the library towers on fire he said catelyn could see the flickering reddish light through the open window now she sagged with relief bran was safe the library was across the bailey there was no way the fire would reach them here thank the gods she whispered robb looked at her as if shed gone mad mother stay here ill come back as soon as the fires out he ran then she heard him shout to the guards outside the room heard them descending together in a wild rush taking the stairs two and three at a time outside there were shouts of fire in the yard screams running footsteps the whinny of frightened horses and the frantic barking of the castle dogs the howling was gone she realized as she listened to the cacophony the direwolves had fallen silent catelyn said a silent prayer of thanks to the seven faces of god as she went to the window across the bailey long tongues of flame shot from the windows of the library she watched the smoke rise into the sky and thought sadly of all the books the starks had gathered over the centuries then she closed the shutters when she turned away from the window the man was in the room with her you werent sposed to be here he muttered sourly no one was sposed to be here he was a small dirty man in filthy brown clothing and he stank of horses catelyn knew all the men who worked in their stables and he was none of them he was gaunt with limp blond hair and pale eyes deep sunk in a bony face and there was a dagger in his hand catelyn looked at the knife then at bran no she said the word stuck in her throat the merest whisper he must have heard her its a mercy he said hes dead already no catelyn said louder now as she found her voice again no you cant she spun back toward the window to scream for help but the man moved faster than she would have believed one hand clamped down over her mouth and yanked back her head the other brought the dagger up to her windpipe the stench of him was overwhelming she reached up with both hands and grabbed the blade with all her strength pulling it away from her throat she heard him cursing into her ear her fingers were slippery with blood but she would not let go of the dagger the hand over her mouth clenched more tightly shutting off her air catelyn twisted her head to the side and managed to get a piece of his flesh between her teeth she bit down hard into his palm the man grunted in pain she ground her teeth together and tore at him and all of a sudden he let go the taste of his blood filled her mouth she sucked in air and screamed and he grabbed her hair and pulled her away from him and she stumbled and went down and then he was standing over her breathing hard shaking the dagger was still clutched tightly in his right hand slick with blood you werent sposed to be here he repeated stupidly catelyn saw the shadow slip through the open door behind him there was a low rumble less than a snarl the merest whisper of a threat but he must have heard something because he started to turn just as the wolf made its leap they went down together half sprawled over catelyn where shed fallen the wolf had him under the jaw the mans shriek lasted less than a second before the beast wrenched back its head taking out half his throat his blood felt like warm rain as it sprayed across her face the wolf was looking at her its jaws were red and wet and its eyes glowed golden in the dark room it was brans wolf she realized of course it was thank you catelyn whispered her voice faint and tiny she lifted her hand trembling the wolf padded closer sniffed at her fingers then licked at the blood with a wet rough tongue when it had cleaned all the blood off her hand it turned away silently and jumped up on brans bed and lay down beside him catelyn began to laugh hysterically that was the way they found them when robb and maester luwin and ser rodrik burst in with half the guards in winterfell when the laughter finally died in her throat they wrapped her in warm blankets and led her back to the great keep to her own chambers old nan undressed her and helped her into a scalding hot bath and washed the blood off her with a soft cloth afterward maester luwin arrived to dress her wounds the cuts in a came of thrones her fingers went deep almost to the bone and her scalp was raw and bleeding where hed pulled out a handful of hair the maester told her the pain was just starting now and gave her milk of the poppy to help her sleep finally she closed her eyes when she opened them again they told her that she had slept four days catelyn nodded and sat up in bed it all seemed like a nightmare to her now everything since brans fall a terrible dream of blood and grief but she had the pain in her hands to remind her that it was real she felt weak and light headed yet strangely resolute as if a great weight had lifted from her bring me some bread and honey she told her servants and take word to maester luwin that my bandages want changing they looked at her in surprise and ran to do her bidding catelyn remembered the way she had been before and she was ashamed she had let them all down her children her husband her house it would not happen again she would show these northerners how strong a tully of riverrun could be robb arrived before her food rodrik cassel came with him and her husbands ward theon greyjoy and lastly hallis mollen a muscular guardsman with a square brown beard he was the new captain of the guard robb said her son was dressed in boiled leather and ringmail she saw and a sword hung at his waist who was he catelyn asked them no one knows his name hallis mollen told her he was no man of winterfell mlady but some says they seen him here and about the castle these past few weeks one of the kings men then she said or one of the lannisters he could have waited behind when the others left maybe hal said with all these strangers filling up winterfell of late theres no way of saying who he belonged to hed been biding in your stables greyjoy said you could smell it on him and how could he go unnoticed she said sharply hallis mollen looked abashed between the horses lord eddard took south and them we sent north to the nights watch the stalls were half empty it were no great trick to hide from the stableboys could be hodor saw him the talk is that boys been acting queer but simple as he is hal shook his head we found where hed been sleeping robb put in he had ninety silver stags in a leather bag buried beneath the straw its good to know my sons life was not sold cheaply catelyn said bitterly hallis mollen looked at her confused begging your grace mlady you saying he was out to kill your boy greyjoy was doubtful thats madness he came for bran catelyn said he kept muttering how i wasnt supposed to be there he set the library fire thinking i would rush to put it out taking any guards with me if i hadnt been half mad with grief it would have worked why would anyone want to kill bran robb said gods hes only a little boy helpless sleeping catelyn gave her firstborn a challenging look if you are to rule in the north you must think these things through robb answer your own question why would anyone want to kill a sleeping child before he could answer the servants returned with a plate of food fresh from the kitchen there was much more than shed asked for hot bread butter and honey and blackberry preserves a rasher of bacon and a soft boiled egg a wedge of cheese a pot of mint tea and with it came maester luwin how is my son maester catelyn looked at all the food and found she had no appetite maester luwin lowered his eyes unchanged my lady it was the reply she had expected no more and no less her hands throbbed with pain as if the blade were still in her cutting deep she sent the servants away and looked back to robb do you have the answer yet someone is afraid bran might wake up robb said afraid of what he might say or do afraid of something he knows catelyn was proud of him very good she turned to the new captain of the guard we must keep bran safe if there was one killer there could be others how many guards do you want rnlady hal asked so long as lord eddard is away my son is the master of winterfell she told him robb stood a little taller put one man in the sickroom night and day one outside the door two at the bottom of the stairs no one sees bran without my warrant or my mothers as you say mlord do it now catelyn suggested and let his wolf stay in the room with him robb added yes catelyn said and then again yes hallis mollen bowed and left the room lady stark ser rodrik said when the guardsman had gone did you chance to notice the dagger the killer used the circumstances did not allow me to examine it closely but i can vouch for its edge catelyn replied with a dry smile why do you ask we found the knife still in the villains grasp it seemed to me that it was altogether too fine a weapon for such a man so i looked at it long and hard the blade is valyrian steel the hilt dragonbone a weapon like that has no business being in the hands of such as him someone gave it to him catelyn nodded thoughtful robb close the door he looked at her strangely but did as she told him what i am about to tell you must not leave this room she told them i want your oaths on that if even part of what i suspect is true ned and my girls have ridden into deadly danger and a word in the wrong ears could mean their lives lord eddard is a second father to me said theon greyjoy i do so swear you have my oath maester luwin said and mine my lady echoed ser rodrik she looked at her son and you robb he nodded his consent my sister lysa believes the lannisters murdered her husband lord arryn the hand of the king catelyn told them it comes to me that jaime lannister did not join the hunt the day bran fell he remained here in the castle the room was deathly quiet i do not think bran fell from that tower she said into the stillness i think he was thrown the shock was plain on their faces my lady that is a monstrous suggestion said rodrik cassel even the kingslayer would flinch at the murder of an innocent child oh would he theon greyjoy asked i wonder there is no limit to lannister pride or lannister ambition catelyn said the boy had always been surehanded in the past maester luwin said thoughtfully he knew every stone in winterfell gods robb swore his young face dark with anger if this is true he will pay for it he drew his sword and waved it in the air ill kill him myself ser rodrik bristled at him put that away the lannisters are a hundred leagues away never draw your sword unless you mean to use it how many times must i tell you foolish boy glorgl r r martin abashed robb sheathed his sword suddenly a child again catelyn said to ser rodrik i see my son is wearing steel now the old master at arms said i thought it was time robb was looking at her anxiously past time she said winterfell may have need of all its swords soon and they had best not be made of wood theon greyjoy put a hand on the hilt of his blade and said my lady if it comes to that my house owes yours a great debt maester luwin pulled at his chain collar where it chafed against his neck all we have is conjecture this is the queens beloved brother we mean to accuse she will not take it kindly we must have proof or forever keep silent your proof is in the dagger ser rodrik said a fine blade like that will not have gone unnoticed there was only one place to find the truth of it catelyn realized someone must go to kings landing ill go robb said no she told him your place is here there must always be a stark in winterfell she looked at ser rodrik with his great white whiskers at maester luwin in his grey robes at young greyjoy lean and dark and impetuous who to send who would be believed then she knew catelyn struggled to push back the blankets her bandaged fingers as stiff and unyielding as stone she climbed out of bed i must go myself my lady said maester luwin is that wise surely the lannisters would greet your arrival with suspicion what about bran robb asked the poor boy looked utterly confused now you cant mean to leave him i have done everything i can for bran she said laying a wounded hand on his arm his life is in the hands of the gods and maester luwin as you reminded me yourself robb i have other children to think of now you will need a strong escort my lady theon said ill send hal with a squad of guardsmen robb said no catelyn said a large party attracts unwelcome attention i would not have the lannisters know i am coming ser rodrik protested my lady let me accompany you at least the kingsroad can be perilous for a woman alone i will not be taking the kingsroad catelyn replied she thought for a moment then nodded her consent two riders can move as fast as one and a good deal faster than a long column burdened by wagons and wheelhouses i will welcome your company ser rodrik we will follow the white knife down to the sea and hire a ship at white harbor strong horses and brisk winds should bring us to kings landing well ahead of ned and the lannisters and then she thought we shall see what we shall see sansa eddard stark had left before dawn septa mordane informed sansa as they broke their fast the king sent for him another hunt i do believe there are still wild aurochs in these lands i am told ive never seen an aurochs sansa said feeding a piece of bacon to lady under the table the direwolf took it from her hand as delicate as a queen septa mordane sniffed in disapproval a noble lady does not feed dogs at her table she said breaking off another piece of comb and letting the honey drip down onto her bread shes not a dog shes a direwolf sansa pointed out as lady licked her fingers with a rough tongue anyway father said we could keep them with us if we want the septa was not appeased youre a good girl sansa but i do vow when it comes to that creature youre as willful as your sister arya she scowled and where is arya this morning she wasnt hungry sansa said knowing full well that her sister had probably stolen down to the kitchen hours ago and wheedled a breakfast out of some cooks boy do remind her to dress nicely today the grey velvet perhaps we are all invited to ride with the queen and princess myrcella in the royal wheelhouse and we must look our best sansa already looked her best she had brushed out her long auburn hair until it shone and picked her nicest blue silks she had been looking forward to today for more than a week it was a great honor to ride with the queen and besides prince joffrey might be there her betrothed just thinking it made her feel a strange fluttering inside even though they were not to marry for years and years sansa did not really know joffrey yet but she was already in love with him he was all she ever dreamt her prince should be tall and handsome and strong with hair like gold she treasured every chance to spend time with him few as they were the only thing that scared her about today was arya arya had a way of ruining everything you never knew what she would do ill tell her sansa said uncertainly but shell dress the way she always does she hoped it wouldnt be too embarrassing may i be excused you may septa mordane helped herself to more bread and honey and sansa slid from the bench lady followed at her heels as she ran from the inns common room outside she stood for a moment amidst the shouts and curses and the creak of wooden wheels as the men broke down the tents and pavilions and loaded the wagons for another days march the inn was a sprawling three story structure of pale stone the biggest that sansa had ever seen but even so it had accommodations for less than a third of the kings party which had swollen to more than four hundred with the addition of her fathers household and the freeriders who had joined them on the road she found arya on the banks of the trident trying to hold nymeria still while she brushed dried mud from her fur the direwolf was not enjoying the process arya was wearing the same riding leathers she had worn yesterday and the day before you better put on something pretty sansa told her septa mordane said so were traveling in the queens wheelhouse with princess myrcella today im not arya said trying to brush a tangle out of nymerias matted grey fur mycah and i are going to ride upstream and look for rubies at the ford rubies sansa said lost what rubies arya gave her a look like she was so stupid rhaegars rubies this is where king robert killed him and won the crown sansa regarded her scrawny little sister in disbelief you cant look for rubies the princess is expecting us the queen invited us both i dont care arya said the wheelhouse doesnt even have windows you cant see a thing what could you want to see sansa said annoyed she had been thrilled by the invitation and her stupid sister was going to ruin everything just as shed feared its all just fields and farms and holdfasts it is not arya said stubbornly if you came with us sometimes youd see i hate riding sansa said fervently all it does is get you soiled and dusty and sore arya shrugged hold still she snapped at nymeria im not hurting you then to sansa she said when we were crossing the neck i counted thirty six flowers i never saw before and mycah showed me a lizard lion sansa shuddered they had been twelve days crossing the neck rumbling down a crooked causeway through an endless black bog and she had hated every moment of it the air had been damp and clammy the causeway so narrow they could not even make proper camp at night they had to stop right on the kingsroad dense thickets of halfdrowned trees pressed close around them branches dripping with curtains of pale fungus huge flowers bloomed in the mud and floated on pools of stagnant water but if you were stupid enough to leave the causeway to pluck them there were quicksands waiting to suck you down and snakes watching from the trees and lizard lions floating half submerged in the water like black logs with eyes and teeth none of which stopped arya of course one day she came back grinning her horsey grin her hair all tangled and her clothes covered in mud clutching a raggedy bunch of purple and green flowers for father sansa kept hoping he would tell arya to behave herself and act like the highborn lady she was supposed to be but he never did he only hugged her and thanked her for the flowers that just made her worse then it turned out the purple flowers were called poison kisses and arya got a rash on her arms sansa would have thought that might have taught her a lesson but arya laughed about it and the next day she rubbed mud all over her arms like some ignorant bog woman just because her friend mycah told her it would stop the itching she had bruises on her arms and shoulders too dark purple welts and faded green and yellow splotches sansa had seen them when her sister undressed for sleep how she had gotten those only the seven gods knew arya was still going on brushing out nymerias tangles and chattering about things shed seen on the trek south last week we found this haunted watchtower and the day before we chased a herd of wild horses you should have seen them run when they caught a scent of nymeria the wolf wriggled in her grasp and arya scolded her stop that i have to do the other side youre all muddy youre not supposed to leave the column sansa reminded her father said so arya shrugged i didnt go far anyway nymeria was with me the whole time i dont always go off either sometimes its fun just to ride along with the wagons and talk to people sansa knew all about the sorts of people arya liked to talk to squires and grooms and serving girls old men and naked children rough spoken freeriders of uncertain birth arya would make friends with anybody this mycah was the worst a butchers boy thirteen and wild he slept in the meat wagon and smelled of the slaughtering block just the sight of him was enough to make sansa feel sick but arya seemed to prefer his company to hers sansa was running out of patience now you have to come with me she told her sister firmly you cant refuse the queen septa mordane will expect you arya ignored her she gave a hard yank with the brush nymeria growled and spun away affronted come back here theres going to be lemon cakes and tea sansa went on all adult and reasonable lady brushed against her leg sansa scratched her ears the way she liked and lady sat beside her on her haunches watching arya chase nymeria why would you want to ride a smelly old horse and get all sore and sweaty when you could recline on feather pillows and eat cakes with the queen i dont like the queen arya said casually sansa sucked in her breath shocked that even arya would say such a thing but her sister prattled on heedless she wont even let me bring nymeria she thrust the brush under her belt and stalked her wolf nymeria watched her approach warily a royal wheelhouse is no place for a wolf sansa said and princess myrcella is afraid of them you know that myrcella is a little baby arya grabbed nymeria around her neck but the moment she pulled out the brush again the direwolf wriggled free and bounded off frustrated arya threw down the brush bad wolf she shouted sansa couldnt help but smile a little the kennelmaster once told her that an animal takes after its master she gave lady a quick little hug lady licked her cheek sansa giggled arya heard and whirled around glaring i dont care what you say im going out riding her long horsey face got the stubborn look that meant she was going to do something willful gods be true arya sometimes you act like such a child sansa said ill go by myself then it will be ever so much nicer that way lady and i will eat all the lemon cakes and just have the best time without you she turned to walk off but arya shouted after her they wont let you bring lady either she was gone before sansa could think of a reply chasing nymeria along the river alone and humiliated sansa took the long way back to the inn where she knew septa mordane would be waiting lady padded quietly by her side she was almost in tears all she wanted was for things to be nice and pretty the way they were in the songs why couldnt arya be sweet and delicate and kind like princess myrcella she would have liked a sister like that sansa could never understand how two sisters born only two years apart could be so different it would have been easier if arya had been a bastard like their half brother jon she even looked like jon with the long face and brown hair of the starks and nothing of their lady mother in her face or her coloring and jons mother had been common or so people whispered once when she was littler sansa had even asked mother if perhaps there hadnt been some mistake perhaps the grumkins had stolen her real sister but mother had only laughed and said no arya was her daughter and sansas trueborn sister blood of their blood sansa could not think why mother would want to lie about it so she supposed it had to be true as she neared the center of camp her distress was quickly forgotten a crowd had gathered around the queens wheelhouse sansa heard excited voices buzzing like a hive of bees the doors had been thrown open she saw and the queen stood at the top of the wooden steps smiling down at someone she heard her saying the council does us great honor my good lords whats happening she asked a squire she knew the council sent riders from kings landing to escort us the rest of the way he told her an honor guard for the king anxious to see sansa let lady clear a path through the crowd people moved aside hastily for the direwolf when she got closer she saw two knights kneeling before the queen in armor so fine and gorgeous that it made her blink one knight wore an intricate suit of white enameled scales brilliant as a field of new fallen snow with silver chasings and clasps that glittered in the sun when he removed his helm sansa saw that he was an old man with hair as pale as his armor yet he seemed strong and graceful for all that from his shoulders hung the pure white cloak of the kingsguard his companion was a man near twenty whose armor was steel plate of a deep forest green he was the handsomest man sansa had ever set eyes upon tall and powerfully made with jet black hair that fell to his shoulders and framed a clean shaven face and laughing green eyes to match his armor cradled under one arm was an antlered helm its magnificent rack shimmering in gold at first sansa did not notice the third stranger he did not kneel with the others he stood to one side beside their horses a gaunt grim man who watched the proceedings in silence his face was pockmarked and beardless with deepset eyes and hollow cheeks though he was not an old man only a few wisps of hair remained to him sprouting above his ears but those he had grown long as a womans his armor was iron grey chainmail over layers of boiled leather plain and unadorned and it spoke of age and hard use above his right shoulder the stained leather hilt of the blade strapped to his back was visible a two handed greatsword too long to be worn at his side the king is gone hunting but i know he will be pleased to see you when he returns the queen was saying to the two knights who knelt before her but sansa could not take her eyes off the third man he seemed to feel the weight of her gaze slowly he turned his head lady growled a terror as overwhelming as anything sansa stark had ever felt filled her suddenly she stepped backward and bumped into someone strong hands grasped her by the shoulders and for a moment sansa thought it was her father but when she turned it was the burned face of sandor clegane looking down at her his mouth twisted in a terrible mockery of a smile you are shaking girl he said his voice rasping do i frighten you so much he did and had since she had first laid eyes on the ruin that fire had made of his face though it seemed to her now that he was not half so terrifying as the other still sansa wrenched away from him and the hound laughed and lady moved between them rumbling a warning sansa dropped to her knees to wrap her arms around the wolf they were all gathered around gaping she could feel their eyes on her and here and there she heard muttered comments and titters of laughter a wolf a man said and someone else said seven hells thats a direwolf and the first man said whats it doing in camp and the hounds rasping voice replied the starks use them for wet nurses and sansa realized that the two stranger knights were looking down on her and lady swords in their hands and then she was frightened again and ashamed tears filled her eyes she heard the queen say joffrey go to her and her prince was there leave her alone joffrey said he stood over her beautiful in blue wool and black leather his golden curls shining in the sun like a crown he gave her his hand drew her to her feet what is it sweet lady why are you afraid no one will hurt you put away your swords all of you the wolf is her little pet thats all he looked at sandor clegane and you dog away with you youre scaring my betrothed the hound ever faithful bowed and slid away quietly through the press sansa struggled to steady herself she felt like such a fool she was a stark of winterfell a noble lady and someday she would be a queen it was not him my sweet prince she tried to explain it was the other one the two stranger knights exchanged a look payne chuckled the young man in the green armor the older man in white spoke to sansa gently ofttimes ser ilyn frightens me as well sweet lady he has a fearsome aspect as well he should the queen had descended from the wheelhouse the spectators parted to make way for her if the wicked do not fear the mngs justice you have put the wrong man in the office sansa finally found her words then surely you have chosen the right one your grace she said and a gale of laughter erupted all around her well spoken child said the old man in white as befits the daughter of eddard stark i am honored to know you however irregular the manner of our meeting i am ser barristan selmy of the kingsguard he bowed sansa knew the name and now the courtesies that septa mordane had taught her over the years came back to her the lord commander of the kingsguard she said and councillor to robert our king and to aerys targaryen before him the honor is mine good knight even in the far north the singers praise the deeds of barristan the bold the green knight laughed again barristan the old you mean dont flatter him too sweetly child he thinks overmuch of himself already he smiled at her now wolf girl if you can put a name to me as well then i must concede that you are truly our hands daughter joffrey stiffened beside her have a care how you address my betrothed can answer sansa said quickly to quell her princes anger she smiled at the green knight your helmet bears golden antlers my lord the stag is the sigil of the royal house king robert has two brothers by your extreme youth you can only be renly baratheon lord of storms end and councillor to the king and so i name you ser barristan chuckled by his extreme youth he can only be a prancing jackanapes and so i name him there was general laughter led by lord renly himself the tension of a few moments ago was gone and sansa was beginning to feel comfortable until ser ilyn payne shouldered two men aside and stood before her unsmiling he did not say a word lady bared her teeth and began to growl a low rumble full of menace but this time sansa silenced the wolf with a gentle hand to the head i am sorry if i offended you ser ilyn she said she waited for an answer but none came as the headsman looked at her his pale colorless eyes seemed to strip the clothes away from her and then the skin leaving her soul naked before him still silent he turned and walked away sansa did not understand she looked at her prince did i say something wrong your grace why will he not speak to me ser ilyn has not been feeling talkative these past fourteen years lord renly commented with a sly smile joffrey gave his uncle a look of pure loathing then took sansas hands in his own aerys targaryen had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers he speaks most eloquently with his sword however the queen said and his devotion to our realm is unquestioned then she smiled graciously and said sansa the good councillors and i must speak together until the king returns with your father i fear we shall have to postpone your day with myrcella please give your sweet sister my apologies joffrey perhaps you would be so kind as to entertain our guest today it would be my pleasure mother joffrey said very formally he took her by the arm and led her away from the wheelhouse and sansas spirits took flight a whole day with her prince she gazed at joffrey worshipfully he was so gallant she thought the way he had rescued her from ser ilyn and the hound why it was almost like the songs like the time serwyn of the mirror shield saved the princess daeryssa from the giants or prince aemon the dragonknight championing queen naeryss honor against evil ser morgils slanders the touch of joffreys hand on her sleeve made her heart beat faster what would you like to do be with you sansa thought but she said whatever youd like to do my prince jofftey reflected a moment we could go riding oh i love riding sansa said joffrey glanced back at lady who was following at their heels your wolf is liable to frighten the horses and my dog seems to frighten you let us leave them both behind and set off on our own what do you say sansa hesitated if you like she said uncertainly i suppose i could tie lady up she did not quite understand though i didnt know you had a dog joffrey laughed hes my mothers dog in truth she has set him to guard me and so he does you mean the hound she said she wanted to hit herself for being so slow her prince would never love her if she seemed stupid is it safe to leave him behind prince joffrey looked annoyed that she would even ask have no fear lady i am almost a man grown and i dont fight with wood like your brothers all i need is this he drew his sword and showed it to her a longsword adroitly shrunken to suit a boy of twelve gleaming blue steel castle forged and double edged with a leather grip and a lions head pommel in gold sansa exclaimed over it admiringly and joffrey looked pleased i call it lions tooth he said and so they left her direwolf and his bodyguard behind them while they ranged east along the north bank of the trident with no company save lions tooth it was a glorious day a magical day the air was warm and heavy with the scent of flowers and the woods here had a gentle beauty that sansa had never seen in the north prince joffreys mount was a blood bay courser swift as the wind and he rode it with reckless abandon so fast that sansa was hard pressed to keep up on her mare it was a day for adventures they explored the caves by the riverbank and tracked a shadowcat to its lair and when they grew hungry joffrey found a holdfast by its smoke and told them to fetch food and wine for their prince and his lady they dined on trout fresh from the river and sansa drank more wine than she had ever drunk before my father only lets us have one cup and only at feasts she confessed to her prince my betrothed can drink as much as she wants joffrey said refilling her cup they went more slowly after they had eaten joffrey sang for her as they rode his voice high and sweet and pure sansa was a little dizzy from the wine shouldnt we be starting back she asked soon joffrey said the battleground is right up ahead where the river bends that was where my father killed rhaegar targaryen you know he smashed in his chest crunch right through the armor joffrey swung an imaginary warhammer to show her how it was done then my uncle jaime killed old aerys and my father was king whats that sound sansa heard it too floating through the woods a kind of wooden clattering snack snack snack i dont know she said it made her nervous though joffrey lets go back i want to see what it is joffrey turned his horse in the direction of the sounds and sansa had no choice but to follow the noises grew louder and more distinct the clack of wood on wood and as they grew closer they heard heavy breathing as well and now and then a grunt someones there sansa said anxiously she found herself thinking of lady wishing the direwolf was with her youre safe with me joffrey drew his lions tooth from its sheath the sound of steel on leather made her tremble this way he said riding through a stand of trees beyond in a clearing overlooking the river they came upon a boy and a girl playing at knights their swords were wooden sticks broom handles from the look of them and they were rushing across the grass swinging at each other lustily the boy was years older a head taller and much stronger and he was pressing the attack the girl a scrawny thing in soiled leathers was dodging and managing to get her stick in the way of most of the boys blows but not all when she tried to lunge at him he caught her stick with his own swept it aside and slid his wood down hard on her fingers she cried out and lost her weapon prince joffrey laughed the boy looked around wide eyed and startled and dropped his stick in the grass the girl glared at them sucking on her knuckles to take the sting out and sansa was horrified arya she called out incredulously go away arya shouted back at them angry tears in her eyes what are you doing here leave us alone joffrey glanced from arya to sansa and back again your sister she nodded blushing joffrey examined the boy an ungainly lad with a coarse freckled face and thick red hair and who are you boy he asked in a commanding tone that took no notice of the fact that the other was a year his senior mycah the boy muttered he recognized the prince and averted his eyes miord hes the butchers boy sansa said hes my friend arya said sharply you leave him alone a butchers boy who wants to be a knight is it joffrey swung down from his mount sword in hand pick up your sword butchers boy he said his eyes bright with amusement let us see how good you are mycah stood there frozen with fear joffrey walked toward him go on pick it up or do you only fight little girls she ast me to mlord mycah said she ast me to sansa had only to glance at arya and see the flush on her sisters face to know the boy was telling the truth but joffrey was in no mood to listen the wine had made him wild are you going to pick up your sword mycah shook his head its only a stick mlord its not no sword its only a stick and youre only a butchers boy and no knight joffrey lifted lions tooth and laid its point on mycahs cheek below the eye as the butchers boy stood trembling that was my ladys sister you were hitting do you know that a bright bud of blood blossomed where his sword pressed into mycahs flesh and a slow red line trickled down the boys cheek stop it arya screamed she grabbed up her fallen stick sansa was afraid arya you stay out of this i wont hurt him much prince joffrey told arya never taking his eyes off the butchers boy arya went for him sansa slid off her mare but she was too slow arya swung with both hands there was a loud crack as the wood split against the back of the princes head and then everything happened at once before sansas horrified eyes joffrey staggered and whirled around roaring curses mycah ran for the trees as fast as his legs would take him arya swung at the prince again but this time joffrey caught the blow on lions tooth and sent her broken stick flying from her hands the back of his head was all bloody and his eyes were on fire sansa was shrieking no no stop it stop it both of you youre spoiling it but no one was listening arya scooped up a rock and hurled it at joffreys head she hit his horse instead and the blood bay reared and went galloping off after mycah stop it dont stop it sansa screamed joffrey slashed at arya with his sword screaming obscenities terrible words filthy words arya darted back frightened now but joffrey followed hounding her toward the woods backing her up against a tree sansa didnt know what to do she watched helplessly almost blind from her tears then a grey blur flashed past her and suddenly nymeria was there leaping jaws closing around joffteys sword arm the steel fell from his fingers as the wolf knocked him off his feet and they rolled in the grass the wolf snarling and ripping at him the prince shrieking in pain get it off he screamed get it off aryas voice cracked like a whip nymefia the direwolf let go of joffrey and moved to aryas side the prince lay in the grass whimpering cradling his mangled arm his shirt was soaked in blood arya said she didnt hurt you much she picked up lions tooth where it had fallen and stood over him holding the sword with both hands jofftey made a scared whimpery sound as he looked up at her no he said dont hurt me ill tell my mother you leave him alone sansa screamed at her sister arya whirled and heaved the sword into the air putting her whole body into the throw the blue steel flashed in the sun as the sword spun out over the river it hit the water and vanished with a splash joffrey moaned arya ran off to her horse nymeria loping at her heels after they had gone sansa went to prince joffrey his eyes were closed in pain his breath ragged sansa knelt beside him joffrey she sobbed oh look what they did look what they did my poor prince dont be afraid ill ride to the holdfast and bring help for you tenderly she reached out and brushed back his soft blond hair his eyes snapped open and looked at her and there was nothing but loathing there nothing but the vilest contempt then go he spit at her and dont touch me eddard theyve found her my lord ned rose quickly our men or lannisters t it was jory his steward vayon poole replied shes not been harmed thank the gods ned said his men had been searching for arya for four days now but the queens men had been out hunting as well where is she tell jory to bring her here at once i am sorry my lord poole told him the guards on the gate were lannister men and they informed the queen when jory brought her in shes being taken directly before the king damn that woman ned said striding to the door find sansa and bring her to the audience chamber her voice may be needed he descended the tower steps in a red rage he had led searches himself for the first three days and had scarcely slept an hour since arya had disappeared this morning he had been so heartsick and weary he could scarcely stand but now his fury was on him filling him with strength men called out to him as he crossed the castle yard but ned ignored them in his haste he would have run but he was still the kings hand and a hand must keep his dignity he was aware of the eyes that followed him of the muttered voices wondering what he would do the castle was a modest holding a half days ride south of the trident the royal party had made themselves the uninvited guests of its lord ser raymun darry while the hunt for arya and the butchers boy was conducted on both sides of the river they were not welcome visitors ser raymun lived under the kings peace but his family had fought beneath rhaegars dragon banners at the trident and his three older brothers had died there a truth neither robert nor ser raymun had forgotten with kings men darry men lannister men and stark men all crammed into a castle far too small for them tensions burned hot and heavy the king had appropriated ser raymuns audience chamber and that was where ned found them the room was crowded when he burst in too crowded he thought left alone he and robert might have been able to settle the matter amicably robert was slumped in darrys high seat at the far end of the room his face closed and sullen cersei lannister and her son stood beside him the queen had her hand on joffreys shoulder thick silken bandages still covered the boys arm arya stood in the center of the room alone but for jory cassel every eye upon her arya ned called loudly he went to her his boots ringing on the stone floor when she saw him she cried out and began to sob ned went to one knee and took her in his arms she was shaking im sorry she sobbed im sorry im sorry i know he said she felt so tiny in his arms nothing but a scrawny little girl it was hard to see how she had caused so much trouble are you hurt no her face was dirty and her tears left pink tracks down her cheeks hungry some i ate some berries but there was nothing else well feed you soon enough ned promised he rose to face the king what is the meaning of this his eyes swept the room searching for friendly faces but for his own men they were few enough ser raymun darry guarded his look well lord renly wore a half smile that might mean anything and old ser barristan was grave the rest were lannister men and hostile their only good fortune was that both jaime lannister and sandor clegane were missing leading searches north of the trident why was i not told that my daughter had been found ned demanded his voice ringing why was she not brought to me at once he spoke to robert but it was cersei lannister who answered how dare you speak to your king in that manner at that the king stirred quiet woman he snapped he straightened in his seat i am sorry ned i never meant to frighten the girl it seemed best to bring her here and get the business done with quickly and what business is that ned put ice in his voice the queen stepped forward you know full well stark this girl of yours attacked my son her and her butchers boy that animal of hers tried to tear his arm off thats not true arya said loudly she just bit him a little he was hurting mycah joff told us what happened the queen said you and the butcher boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him thats not how it was arya said close to tears again ned put a hand on her shoulder yes it is prince joffrey insisted they all attacked me and she threw lions tooth in the river ned noticed that he did not so much as glance at arya as he spoke liar arya yelled shut up the prince yelled back enough the king roared rising from his seat his voice thick with irritation silence fell he glowered at arya through his thick beard now child you will tell me what happened tell it all and tell it true it is a great crime to lie to a king then he looked over at his son when she is done you will have your turn until then hold your tongue as arya began her story ned heard the door open behind him he glanced back and saw vayon poole enter with sansa they stood quietly at the back of the hall as arya spoke when she got to the part where she threw joffreys sword into the middle of the trident renly baratheon began to laugh the king bristled ser barristan escort my brother from the hall before he chokes lord renly stifled his laughter my brother is too kind i can find the door myself he bowed to joffrey perchance later youll tell me how a nine year old girl the size of a wet rat managed to disarm you with a broom handle and throw your sword in the river as the door swung shut behind him ned heard him say lions tooth and guffaw once more prince joffrey was pale as he began his very different version of events when his son was done talking the king rose heavily from his seat looking like a man who wanted to be anywhere but here what in all the seven hells am i supposed to make of this he says one thing she says another they were not the only ones present ned said sansa come here ned had heard her version of the story the night arya had vanished he knew the truth tell us what happened his eldest daughter stepped forward hesitantly she was dressed in blue velvets trimmed with white a silver chain around her neck her thick auburn hair had been brushed until it shone she blinked at her sister then at the young prince i dont know she said tearfully looking as though she wanted to bolt i dont remember everything happened so fast i didnt see you rotten arya shrieked she flew at her sister like an arrow knocking sansa down to the ground pummeling her liar liar liar liar arya stop it ned shouted jory pulled her off her sister kicking sansa was pale and shaking as ned lifted her back to her feet are you hurt he asked but she was staring at arya and she did not seem to hear the girl is as wild as that filthy animal of hers cersei lannister said robert i want her punished seven hells robert swore cersei look at her shes a child what would you have me do whip her through the streets damn it children fight its over no lasting harm was done the queen was furious joff will carry those scars for the rest of his life robert baratheon looked at his eldest son so he will perhaps they will teach him a lesson ned see that your daughter is disciplined i will do the same with my son gladly your grace ned said with vast relief robert started to walk away but the queen was not done and what of the direwolf she called after him what of the beast that savaged your son the king stopped turned back frowned id forgotten about the damned wolf ned could see arya tense in jorys arms jory spoke up quickly we found no trace of the direwolf your grace robert did not look unhappy no so be it the queen raised her voice a hundred golden dragons to the man who brings me its skin a costly pelt robert grumbled i want no part of this woman you can damn well buy your furs with lannister gold the queen regarded him coolly i had not thought you so niggardly the king id thought to wed would have laid a wolfskin across my bed before the sun went down roberts face darkened with anger that would be a fine trick without a wolf we have a wolf cersei lannister said her voice was very quiet but her green eyes shone with triumph it took them all a moment to comprehend her words but when they did the king shrugged irritably as you will have ser ilyn see to it robert you cannot mean this ned protested the king was in no mood for more argument enough ned i will hear no more a direwolf is a savage beast sooner or later it would have turned on your girl the same way the other did on my son get her a dog shell be happier for it that was when sansa finally seemed to comprehend her eyes were frightened as they went to her father he doesnt mean lady does he she saw the truth on his face no she said no not lady lady didnt bite anybody shes good lady wasnt there arya shouted angrily you leave her alone stop them sansa pleaded dont let them do it please please it wasnt lady it was nymeria arya did it you cant it wasnt lady dont let them hurt lady ill make her be good i promise i promise she started to cry all ned could do was take her in his arms and hold her while she wept he looked across the room at robert his old friend closer than any brother please robert for the love you bear me for the love you bore my sister please the king looked at them for a long moment then turned his eyes on his wife damn you cersei he said with loathing ned stood gently disengaging himself from sansas grasp all the weariness of the past four days had returned to him do it yourself then robert he said in a voice cold and sharp as steel at least have the courage to do it yourself robert looked at ned with flat dead eyes and left without a word his footsteps heavy as lead silence filled the hall where is the direwolf cersei lannister asked when her husband was gone beside her prince joffrey was smiling the beast is chained up outside the gatehouse your grace ser barristan selmy answered reluctantly send for ilyn payne no ned said jory take the girls back to their rooms and bring me ice the words tasted of bile in his throat but he forced them out if it must be done i will do it cersei lannister regarded him suspiciously you stark is this some trick why would you do such a thing they were all staring at him but it was sansas look that cut she is of the north she deserves better than a butcher he left the room with his eyes burning and his daughters wails echoing in his ears and found the direwolf pup where they chained her ned sat beside her for a while lady he said tasting the name he had never paid much attention to the names the children had picked but looking at her now he knew that sansa had chosen well she was the smallest of the litter the prettiest the most gentle and trusting she looked at him with bright golden eyes and he ruffled her thick grey fur shortly jory brought him ice when it was over he said choose four men and have them take the body north bury her at winterfell all that way jory said astonished all that way ned affirmed the lannister woman shall never have this skin he was walking back to the tower to give himself up to sleep at last when sandor clegane and his riders came pounding through the castle gate back from their hunt there was something slung over the back of his destrier a heavy shape wrapped in a bloody cloak no sign of your daughter hand the hound rasped down but the day was not wholly wasted we got her little pet he reached back and shoved the burden off and it fell with a thump in front of ned bending ned pulled back the cloak dreading the words he would have to find for arya but it was not nymeria after all it was the butchers boy mycah his body covered in dried blood he had been cut almost in half from shoulder to waist by some terrible blow struck from above you rode him down ned said the hounds eyes seemed to glitter through the steel of that hideous dogs head helm he ran he looked at neds face and laughed but not very fast bran it seemed as though he had been falling for years fly a voice whispered in the darkness but bran did not know thow to fly so all he could do was fall maester luwin made a little boy of clay baked him till he was hard and brittle dressed him in brans clothes and flung him off a roof bran remembered the way he shattered but i never fall he said falling the ground was so far below him he could barely make it out through the grey mists that whirled around him but he could feel how fast he was falling and he knew what was waiting for him down there even in dreams you could not fall forever he would wake up in the instant before he hit the ground he knew you always woke up in the instant before you hit the ground and if you dont the voice asked the ground was closer now still far far away a thousand miles away but closer than it had been it was cold here in the darkness there was no sun no stars only the ground below coming up to smash him and the grey mists and the whispering voice he wanted to cry not cry fly i cant fly bran said i cant i cant how do you know have you ever tried the voice was high and thin bran looked around to see where it was coming from a crow was spiraling down with him just out of reach following him as he fell help me he said im trying the crow replied say got any corn bran reached into his pocket as the darkness spun dizzily around him when he pulled his hand out golden kernels slid from between his fingers into the air they fell with him the crow landed on his hand and began to eat are you really a crow bran asked are you really falling the crow asked back its just a dream bran said is it asked the crow ill wake up when i hit the ground bran told the bird youll die when you hit the ground the crow said it went back to eating corn bran looked down he could see mountains now their peaks white with snow and the silver thread of rivers in dark woods he closed his eyes and began to cry that wont do any good the crow said i told you the answer is flying not crying how hard can it be im doing it the crow took to the air and flapped around brans hand you have wings bran pointed out maybe you do too bran felt along his shoulders groping for feathers there are different kinds of wings the crow said bran was staring at his arms his legs he was so skinny just skin stretched taut over bones had he always been so thin he tried to remember a face swam up at him out of the grey mist shining with light golden the things i do for love it said bran screamed the crow took to the air cawing not that it shrieked at him forget that you do not need it now put it aside put it away it landed on brans shoulder and pecked at him and the shining golden face was gone bran was falling faster than ever the grey mists howled around him as he plunged toward the earth below what are you doing to me he asked the crow tearful teaching you how to fly i cant fly youre flying tight now fm falling every flight begins with a fall the crow said look down im afraid lookdown bran looked down and felt his insides turn to water the ground was rushing up at him now the whole world was spread out below him a tapestry of white and brown and green he could see everything so clearly that for a moment he forgot to be afraid he could see the whole realm and everyone in it he saw winterfell as the eagles see it the tall towers looking squat and stubby from above the castle walls just lines in the dirt he saw maester luwin on his balcony studying the sky through a polished bronze tube and frowning as he made notes in a book he saw his brother robb taller and stronger than he remembered him practicing swordplay in the yard with real steel in his hand he saw hodor the simple giant from the stables carrying an anvil to mikkens forge hefting it onto his shoulder as easily as another man might heft a bale of hay at the heart of the godswood the great white weirwood brooded over its reflection in the black pool its leaves rustling in a chill wind when it felt bran watching it lifted its eyes from the still waters and stared back at him knowingly he looked east and saw a galley racing across the waters of the bite he saw his mother sitting alone in a cabin looking at a bloodstained knife on a table in front of her as the rowers pulled at their oars and ser rodrik leaned across a rail shaking and heaving a storm was gathering ahead of them a vast dark roaring lashed by lightning but somehow they could not see it he looked south and saw the great blue green rush of the trident he saw his father pleading with the king his face etched with grief he saw sansa crying herself to sleep at night and he saw arya watching in silence and holding her secrets hard in her heart there were shadows all around them one shadow was dark as ash with the terrible face of a hound another was armored like the sun golden and beautiful over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone but when he opened his visor there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood he lifted his eyes and saw clear across the narrow sea to the free cities and the green dothraki sea and beyond to vaes dothrak under its mountain to the fabled lands of the jade sea to asshai by the shadow where dragons stirred beneath the sunrise finally he looked north he saw the wall shining like blue crystal and his bastard brother jon sleeping alone in a cold bed his skin growing pale and hard as the memory of all warmth fled from him and he looked past the wall past endless forests cloaked in snow past the frozen shore and the great blue white rivers of ice and the dead plains where nothing grew or lived north and north and north he looked to the curtain of light at the end of the world and then beyond that curtain he looked deep into the heart of winter and then he cried out afraid and the heat of his tears burned on his cheeks now you know the crow whispered as it sat on his shoulder now you know why you must live why bran said not understanding falling falling because winter is coming bran looked at the crow on his shoulder and the crow looked back it had three eyes and the third eye was full of a terrible knowledge bran looked down there was nothing below him now but snow and cold and death a frozen wasteland where jagged blue white spires of ice waited to embrace him they flew up at him like spears he saw the bones of a thousand other dreamers impaled upon their points he was desperately afraid can a man still be brave if hes afraid he heard his own voice saying small and far away and his fathers voice replied to him that is the only time a man can be brave now bran the crow urged choose fly or die death reached for him screaming bran spread his arms and flew wings unseen drank the wind and filled and pulled him upward the terrible needles of ice receded below him the sky opened up above bran soared it was better than climbing it was better than anything the world grew small beneath him im flying he cried out in delight ive noticed said the three eyed crow it took to the air flapping its wings in his face slowing him blinding him he faltered in the air as its pinions beat against his cheeks its beak stabbed at him fiercely and bran felt a sudden blinding pain in the middle of his forehead between his eyes what are you doing he shrieked the crow opened its beak and cawed at him a shrill scream of fear and the grey mists shuddered and swirled around him and ripped away like a veil and he saw that the crow was really a woman a serving woman with long black hair and he knew her from somewhere from winterfell yes that was it he remembered her now and then he realized that he was in winterfell in a bed high in some chilly tower room and the black haired woman dropped a basin of water to shatter on the floor and ran down the steps shouting hes awake hes awake hes awake bran touched his forehead between his eyes the place where the crow had pecked him was still burning but there was nothing there no blood no wound he felt weak and dizzy he tried to get out of bed but nothing happened and then there was movement beside the bed and something landed lightly on his legs he felt nothing a pair of yellow eyes looked into his own shining like the sun the window was open and it was cold in the room but the warmth that came off the wolf enfolded him like a hot bath his pup bran realized or was it he was so big now he reached out to pet him his hand trembling like a leaf when his brother robb burst into the room breathless from his dash up the tower steps the direwolf was licking brans face bran looked up calmly his name is summer he said catelyn we will make kings landing within the hour catelyn turned away from the rail and forced herself to smile your oarmen have done well by us captain each one of them shall have a silver stag as a token of my gratitude captain moreo turnitis favored her with a half bow you are far too generous lady stark the honor of carrying a great lady like yourself is all the reward they need but theyll take the silver anyway moreo smiled as you say he spoke the common tongue fluently with only the slightest hint of a tyroshi accent hed been plying the narrow sea for thirty years hed told her as oarman quartermaster and finally captain of his own trading galleys the stonn dancer was his fourth ship and his fastest a two masted galley of sixty oars she had certainly been the fastest of the ships available in white harbor when catelyn and ser rodrik cassel had arrived after their headlong gallop downriver the tyroshi were notorious for their avarice and ser rodrik had argued for hiring a fishing sloop out of the three sisters but catelyn had insisted on the galley it was good that she had the winds had been against them much of the voyage and without the galleys oars theyd still be beating their way past the fingers instead of skimming toward kings landing and journeys end so close she thought beneath the linen bandages her fingers still throbbed where the dagger had bitten the pain was her scourge catelyn felt lest she forget she could not bend the last two fingers on her left hand and the others would never again be dexterous yet that was a small enough price to pay for brans life ser rodrik chose that moment to appear on deck my good friend said moreo through his forked green beard the tyroshi loved bright colors even in their facial hair it is so fine to see you looking better yes ser rodrik agreed i havent wanted to die for almost two days now he bowed to catelyn my lady he was looking better a shade thinner than he had been when they set out from white harbor but almost himself again the strong winds in the bite and the roughness of the narrow sea had not agreed with him and hed almost gone over the side when the storm seized them unexpectedly off dragonstone yet somehow he had clung to a rope until three of moreos men could rescue him and carry him safely below decks the captain was just telling me that our voyage is almost at an end she said ser rodrik managed a wry smile so soon he looked odd without his great white side whiskers smaller somehow less fierce and ten years older yet back on the bite it had seemed prudent to submit to a crewmans razor after his whiskers had become hopelessly befouled for the third time while he leaned over the rail and retched into the swirling winds i will leave you to discuss your business captain moreo said he bowed and took his leave of them the galley skimmed the water like a dragonfly her oars rising and falling in perfect time ser rodrik held the rail and looked out over the passing shore i have not been the most valiant of protectors catelyn touched his arm we are here ser rodrik and safely that is all that truly matters her hand groped beneath her cloak her fingers stiff and fumbling the dagger was still at her side she found she had to touch it now and then to reassure herself now we must reach the kings master at arms and pray that he can be trusted ser aron santagar is a vain man but an honest one ser rodriks hand went to his face to stroke his whiskers and discovered once again that they were gone he looked nonplussed he may know the blade yes but my lady the moment we go ashore we are at risk and there are those at court who will know you on sight catelyns mouth grew tight littlefinger she murmured his face swam up before her a boys face though he was a boy no longer his father had died several years before so he was lord baelish now yet still they called him littlefinger her brother edmure had given him that name long ago at riverrun his familys modest holdings were on the smallest of the fingers and petyr had been slight and short for his age ser rodrik cleared his throat lord baelish once ah his thought trailed off uncertainly in search of the polite word catelyn was past delicacy he was my fathers ward we grew up together in riverrun i thought of him as a brother but his feelings for me were more than brotherly when it was announced that i was to wed brandon stark petyr challenged for the right to my hand it was madness brandon was twenty petyr scarcely fifteen i had to beg brandon to spare petyrs life he let him off with a scar afterward my father sent him away i have not seen him since she lifted her face to the spray as if the brisk wind could blow the memories away he wrote to me at riverrun after brandon was killed but i burned the letter unread by then i knew that ned would marry me in his brothers place ser rodriks fingers fumbled once again for nonexistent whiskers littlefinger sits on the small council now i knew he would rise high catelyn said he was always clever even as a boy but it is one thing to be clever and another to be wise i wonder what the years have done to him high overhead the far eyes sang out from the rigging captain moreo came scrambling across the deck giving orders and all around them the stonn dancer burst into frenetic activity as kings landing slid into view atop its three high hills three hundred years ago catelyn knew those heights had been covered with forest and only a handful of fisherfolk had lived on the north shore of the blackwater rush where that deep swift river flowed into the sea then aegon the conqueror had sailed from dragonstone it was here that his army had put ashore and there on the highest hill that he built his first crude redoubt of wood and earth now the city covered the shore as far as catelyn could see manses and arbors and granaries brick storehouses and timbered inns and merchants stalls taverns and graveyards and brothels all piled one on another she could hear the clamor of the fish market even at this distance between the buildings were broad roads lined with trees wandering crookback streets and alleys so narrow that two men could not walk abreast visenyas hill was crowned by the great sept of baelor with its seven crystal towers across the city on the hill of rhaenys stood the blackened walls of the dragonpit its huge dome collapsing into ruin its bronze doors closed now for a century the street of the sisters ran between them straight as an arrow the city walls rose in the distance high and strong a hundred quays lined the waterfront and the harbor was crowded with ships deepwater fishing boats and river runners came and went ferrymen poled back and forth across the blackwater rush trading galleys unloaded goods from braavos and pentos and lys catelyn sp ied the queens ornate barge tied up beside a fat bellied whaler from the port of ibben its hull black with tar while upriver a dozen lean golden warships rested in their cribs sails furled and cruel iron rams lapping at the water and above it all frowning down from aegons high hill was the red keep seven huge drum towers crowned with iron ramparts an immense grim barbican vaulted halls and covered bridges barracks and dungeons and granaries massive curtain walls studded with archers nests all fashioned of pale red stone aegon the conqueror had commanded it built his son maegor the cruel had seen it completed afterward he had taken the heads of every stonemason woodworker and builder who had labored on it only the blood of the dragon would ever know the secrets of the fortress the dragonlords had built he vowed yet now the banners that flew from its battlements were golden not black and where the three headed dragon had once breathed fire now pranced the crowned stag of house baratheon a high masted swan ship from the summer isles was beating out from port its white sails huge with wind the stonn dancer moved past it pulling steadily for shore my lady ser rodrik said i have thought on how best to proceed while i lay abed you must not enter the castle i will go in your stead and bring ser aron to you in some safe place she studied the old knight as the galley drew near to a pier moreo was shouting in the vulgar valyrian of the free cities you would be as much at risk as i would ser rodrik smiled i think not i looked at my reflection in the water earlier and scarcely recognized myself my mother was the last person to see me without whiskers and she is forty years dead i believe i am safe enough my lady moreo bellowed a command as one sixty oars lifted from the river then reversed and backed water the galley slowed another shout the oars slid back inside the hull as they thumped against the dock tyroshi seamen leapt down to tie up moreo came bustling up all smiles kings landing my lady as you did command and never has a ship made a swifter or surer passage will you be needing assistance to carry your things to the castle we shall not be going to the castle perhaps you can suggest an inn someplace clean and comfortable and not too far from the river the tyroshi fingered his forked green beard just so i know of several establishments that might suit your needs yet first if i may be so bold there is the matter of the second half of the payment we agreed upon and of course the extra silver you were so kind as to promise sixty stags i believe it was for the oarmen catelyn reminded him oh of a certainty said moreo though perhaps i should hold it for them until we return to tyrosh for the sake of their wives and children if you give them the silver here my lady they will dice it away or spend it all for a nights pleasure there are worse things to spend money on ser rodrik put in winter is coming a man must make his own choices catelyn said they earned the silver how they spend it is no concern of mine as you say my lady moreo replied bowing and smiling just to be sure catelyn paid the oarmen herself a stag to each man and a copper to the two men who carried their chests halfway up visenyas hill to the inn that moreo had suggested it was a rambling old place on eel alley the woman who owned it was a sour crone with a wandering eye who looked them over suspiciously and bit the coin that catelyn offered her to make sure it was real her rooms were large and airy though and moreo swore that her fish stew was the most savory in all the seven kingdoms best of all she had no interest in their names i think it best if you stay away from the common room ser rodrik said after they had settled in even in a place like this one never knows who may be watching he wore ringmail dagger and longsword under a dark cloak with a hood he could pull up over his head i will be back before nightfall with ser aron he promised rest now my lady catelyn was tired the voyage had been long and fatiguing and she was no longer as young as she had been her windows opened on the alley and rooftops with a view of the blackwater beyond she watched ser rodrik set off striding briskly through the busy streets until he was lost in the crowds then decided to take his advice the bedding was stuffed with straw instead of feathers but she had no trouble falling asleep she woke to a pounding on her door catelyn sat up sharply outside the window the rooftops of kings landing were red in the light of the setting sun she had slept longer than she intended a fist hammered at her door again and a voice called out open in the name of the king a moment she called out she wrapped herself in her cloak the dagger was on the bedside table she snatched it up before she unlatched the heavy wooden door the men who pushed into the room wore the black ringmail and golden cloaks of the city watch their leader smiled at the dagger in her hand and said no need for that m ady were to escort you to the castle by whose authority she said he showed her a ribbon catelyn felt her breath catch in her throat the seal was a mockingbird in grey wax petyr she said so soon something must have happened to ser rodrik she looked at the head guardsman do you know who i am no mlady he said mlord littlefinger said only to bring you to him and see that you were not mistreated catelyn nodded you may wait outside while i dress she bathed her hands in the basin and wrapped them in clean linen her fingers were thick and awkward as she struggled to lace up her bodice and knot a drab brown cloak about her neck how could littlefinger have known she was here ser rodrik would never have told him old he might be but he was stubborn and loyal to a fault were they too late had the lannisters reached kings landing before her no if that were true ned would be here too and surely he would have come to her how then she thought moreo the tyroshi knew who they were and where they were damn him she hoped hed gotten a good price for the information they had brought a horse for her the lamps were being lit along the streets as they set out and catelyn felt the eyes of the city on her as she rode surrounded by the guard in their golden cloaks when they reached the red keep the portcullis was down and the great gates sealed for the night but the castle windows were alive with flickering lights the guardsmen left their mounts outside the walls and escorted her through a narrow postern door then up endless steps to a tower he was alone in the room seated at a heavy wooden table an oil lamp beside him as he wrote when they ushered her inside he set down his pen and looked at her cat he said quietly why have i been brought here in this fashion he rose and gestured brusquely to the guards leave us the men departed you were not mistreated i trust he said after they had gone i gave firm instructions he noticed her bandages your hands catelyn ignored the implied question i am not accustomed to being summoned like a serving wench she said icily as a boy you still knew the meaning of courtesy ive angered you my lady that was never my intent he looked contrite the look brought back vivid memories for catelyn he had been a sly child but after his mischiefs he always looked contrite it was a gift he had the years had not changed him much petyr had been a small boy and he had grown into a small man an inch or two shorter than catelyn slender and quick with the sharp features she remembered and the same laughing grey green eyes he had a little pointed chin beard now and threads of silver in his dark hair though he was still shy of thirty they went well with the silver mockingbird that fastened his cloak even as a child he had always loved his silver how did you know i was in the city she asked him lord varys knows all petyr said with a sly smile he will be joining us shortly but i wanted to see you alone first it has been too long cat how many years catelyn ignored his familiarity there were more important questions so it was the kings spider who found me littlefinger winced you dont want to call him that hes very sensitive comes of being an eunuch i imagine nothing happens in this city without varys knowing oftimes he knows about it before it happens he has informants everywhere his little birds he calls them one of his little birds heard about your visit thankfully varys came to me first why you he shrugged why not me i am master of coin the kings own councillor selmy and lord renly rode north to meet robert and lord stannis is gone to dragonstone leaving only maester pycelle and me i was the obvious choice i was ever a friend to your sister lysa varys knows that does varys know about lord varys knows everything except why you are here he lifted an eyebrow why are you here a wife is allowed to yearn for her husband and if a mother needs her daughters close who can tell her no littlefinger laughed oh very good my lady but please dont expect me to believe that i know you too well what were the tully words again her throat was dry family duty honor she recited stiffly he did know her too well family duty honor he echoed all of which required you to remain in winterfell where our hand left you no my lady something has happened this sudden trip of yours bespeaks a certain urgency i beg of you let me help old sweet friends should never hesitate to rely upon each other there was a soft knock on the door enter littlefinger called out the man who stepped through the door was plump perfumed powdered and as hairless as an egg he wore a vest of woven gold thread over a loose gown of purple silk and on his feet were pointed slippers of soft velvet lady stark he said taking her hand in both of his to see you again after so many years is such a joy his flesh was soft and moist and his breath smelled of lilacs oh your poor hands have you burned yourself sweet lady the fingers are so delicate our good maester pycelle makes a marvelous salve shall i send for a jar catelyn slid her fingers from his grasp i thank you my lord but my own maester luwin has already seen to my hurts varys bobbed his head i was grievous sad to hear about your son and him so young the gods are cruel on that we agree lord varys she said the title was but a courtesy due him as a council member varys was lord of nothing but the spiderweb the master of none but his whisperers the eunuch spread his soft hands on more than that i hope sweet lady i have great esteem for your husband our new hand and i know we do both love king robert yes she was forced to say for a certainty never has a king been so beloved as our robert quipped littlefinger he smiled slyly at least in lord varyss hearing good lady varys said with great solicitude there are men in the free cities with wondrous healing powers say only the word and i will send for one for your dear bran maester luwin is doing all that can be done for bran she told him she would not speak of bran not here not with these men she trusted littlefinger only a little and varys not at all she would not let them see her grief lord baelish tells me that i have you to thank for bringing me here varys giggled like a little girl oh yes i suppose i am guilty i hope you forgive me kind lady he eased himself down into a seat and put his hands together i wonder if we might trouble you to show us the dagger catelyn stark stared at the eunuch in stunned disbelief he was a spider she thought wildly an enchanter or worse he knew things no one could possibly know unless what have you done to ser rodrik she demanded littlefinger was lost i feel rather like the knight who arrives at the battle without his lance what dagger are we talking about who is ser rodrik ser rodrik cassel is master at arms at winterfell varys informed him i assure you lady stark nothing at all has been done to the good knight he did call here early this afternoon he visited with ser aron santagar in the armory and they talked of a certain dagger about sunset they left the castle together and walked to that dreadful hovel where you were staying they are still there drinking in the common room waiting for your return ser rodrik was very distressed to find you gone how could you know all that the whisperings of little birds varys said smiling i know things sweet lady that is the nature of my service he shrugged you do have the dagger with you yes catelyn pulled it out from beneath her cloak and threw it down on the table in front of him here perhaps your little birds will whisper the name of the man it belongs to varys lifted the knife with exaggerated delicacy and ran a thumb along its edge blood welled and he let out a squeal and dropped the dagger back on the table careful catelyn told him its sharp nothing holds an edge like valyrian steel littlefinger said as varys sucked at his bleeding thumb and looked at catelyn with sullen admonition littlefinger hefted the knife lightly in his hand testing the grip he flipped it in the air caught it again with his other hand such sweet balance you want to find the owner is that the reason for this visit you have no need of ser aron for that my lady you should have come to me and if i had she said what would you have told me i would have told you that there was only one knife like this at kings landing he grasped the blade between thumb and forefinger drew it back over his shoulder and threw it across the room with a practiced flick of his wrist it struck the door and buried itself deep in the oak quivering its mine yours it made no sense petyr had not been at winterfell until the tourney on prince joffreys name day he said crossing the room to wrench the dagger from the wood i backed ser jaime in the jousting along with half the court petyrs sheepish grin made him look half a boy again when loras tyrell unhorsed him many of us became a trifle poorer ser jaime lost a hundred golden dragons the queen lost an emerald pendant and i lost my knife her grace got the emerald back but the winner kept the rest who catelyn demanded her mouth dry with fear her fingers ached with remembered pain the imp said littlefinger as lord varys watched her face tyrion lannister jon the courtyard rang to the song of swords under black wool boiled leather and mail sweat trickled icily down jons chest as he pressed the attack grenn stumbled backward defending himself clumsily when he raised his sword jon went underneath it with a sweeping blow that crunched against the back of the other boys leg and sent him staggering grenns downcut was answered by an overhand that dented his helm when he tried a sideswing jon swept aside his blade and slammed a mailed forearm into his chest grenn lost his footing and sat down hard in the snow jon knocked his sword from his fingers with a slash to his wrist that brought a cry of pain enough ser alliser thorne had a voice with an edge like valyrian steel grenn cradled his hand the bastard broke my wrist the bastard hamstrung you opened your empty skull and cut off your hand or would have if these blades had an edge its fortunate for you that the watch needs stableboys as well as rangers ser alliser gestured at jeren and toad get the aurochs on his feet he has funeral arrangements to make jon took off his helm as the other boys were pulling grenn to his feet the frosty morning air felt good on his face he leaned on his sword drew a deep breath and allowed himself a moment to savor the victory that is a longsword not an old mans cane ser alliser said sharply are your legs hurting lord snow jon hated that name a mockery that ser alliser had hung on him the first day he came to practice the boys had picked it up and now he heard it everywhere he slid the longsword back into its scabbard no he replied thorne strode toward him crisp black leathers whispering faintly as he moved he was a compact man of fifty years spare and hard with grey in his black hair and eyes like chips of onyx the truth now he commanded im tired jon admitted his arm burned from the weight of the longsword and he was starting to feel his bruises now that the fight was done what you are is weak i won no the aurochs lost one of the other boys sniggered jon knew better than to reply he had beaten everyone that ser alliser had sent against him yet it gained him nothing the master at arms served up only derision thorne hated him jon had decided of course he hated the other boys even worse that will be all thorne told them i can only stomach so much ineptitude in any one day if the others ever come for us i pray they have archers because you lot are fit for nothing more than arrow fodder jon followed the rest back to the armory walking alone he often walked alone here there were almost twenty in the group he trained with yet not one he could call a friend most were two or three years his senior yet not one was half the fighter robb had been at fourteen dareon was quick but afraid of being hit pyp used his sword like a dagger jeren was weak as a girl grenn slow and clumsy halders blows were brutally hard but he ran right into your attacks the more time he spent with them the more jon despised them inside jon hung sword and scabbard from a hook in the stone wall ignoring the others around him methodically he began to strip off his mail leather and sweat soaked woolens chunks of coal burned in iron braziers at either end of the long room but jon found himself shivering the chill was always with him here in a few years he would forget what it felt like to be warm the weariness came on him suddenly as he donned the roughspun blacks that were their everyday wear he sat on a bench his fingers fumbling with the fastenings on his cloak so cold he thought remembering the warm halls of winterfell where the hot waters ran through the walls like blood through a mans body there was scant warmth to be found in castle black the walls were cold here and the people colder no one had told him the nights watch would be like this no one except tyrion lannister the dwarf had given him the truth on the road north but by then it had been too late jon wondered if his father had known what the wall would be like he must have he thought that only made it hurt the worse even his uncle had abandoned him in this cold place at the end of the world up here the genial benjen stark he had known became a different person he was first ranger and he spent his days and nights with lord commander mormont and maester aemon and the other high officers while jon was given over to the less than tender charge of ser alliser thorne three days after their arrival jon had heard that benjen stark was to lead a half dozen men on a ranging into the haunted forest that night he sought out his uncle in the great timbered common hall and pleaded to go with him benjen refused him curtly this is not winterfell he told him as he cut his meat with fork and dagger on the wall a man gets only what he earns youre no ranger jon only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you stupidly jon argued ill be fifteen on my name day he said almost a man grown benjen stark frowned a boy you are and a boy youll remain until ser alliser says you are fit to be a man of the nights watch if you thought your stark blood would win you easy favors you were wrong we put aside our old families when we swear our vows your father will always have a place in my heart but these are my brothers now he gestured with his dagger at the men around them all the hard cold men in black jon rose at dawn the next day to watch his uncle leave one of his rangers a big ugly man sang a bawdy song as he saddled his garron his breath steaming in the cold morning air ben stark smiled at that but he had no smile for his nephew how often must i tell you no jon well speak when i return as he watched his uncle lead his horse into the tunnel jon had remembered the things that tyrion lannister told him on the kingsroad and in his minds eye he saw ben stark lying dead his blood red on the snow the thought made him sick what was he becoming afterward he sought out ghost in the loneliness of his cell and buried his face in his thick white fur if he must be alone he would make solitude his armor castle black had no godswood only a small sept and a drunken septon but jon could not find it in him to pray to any gods old or new if they were real he thought they were as cruel and implacable as winter he missed his true brothers little rickon bright eyes shining as he begged for a sweet robb his rival and best friend and constant companion bran stubborn and curious always wanting to follow and join in whatever jon and robb were doing he missed the girls too even sansa who never called him anything but my half brother since she was old enough to understand what bastard meant and arya he missed her even more than robb skinny little thing that she was all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes so fierce and willful arya never seemed to fit no more than he had yet she could always make jon smile he would give anything to be with her now to muss up her hair once more and watch her make a face to hear her finish a sentence with him you broke my wrist bastard boy jon lifted his eyes at the sullen voice grenn loomed over him thick of neck and red of face with three of his friends behind him he knew todder a short ugly boy with an unpleasant voice the recruits all called him toad the other two were the ones yoren had brought north with them jon remembered rapers taken down in the fingers hed forgotten their names he hardly ever spoke to them if he could help it they were brutes and bullies without a thimble of honor between them jon stood up ill break the other one for you if you ask nicely grenn was sixteen and a head taller than jon all four of them were bigger than he was but they did not scare him hed beaten every one of them in the yard maybe well break you one of the rapers said try jon reached back for his sword but one of them grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back you make us look bad complained toad you looked bad before i ever met you jon told him the boy who had his arm jerked upward on him hard pain lanced through him but jon would not cry out toad stepped close the little lordling has a mouth on him he said he had pig eyes small and shiny is that your mommys mouth bastard what was she some whore tell us her name maybe i had her a time or two he laughed jon twisted like an eel and slammed a heel down across the instep of the boy holding him there was a sudden cry of pain and he was free he flew at toad knocked him backward over a bench and landed on his chest with both hands on his throat slamming his head against the packed earth the two from the fingers pulled him off throwing him roughly to the ground grenn began to kick at him jon was rolling away from the blows when a booming voice cut through the gloom of the armory stop this now jon pulled himself to his feet donal noye stood glowering at them the yard is for fighting the armorer said keep your quarrels out of my armory or ill make them my quarrels you wont like that toad sat on the floor gingerly feeling the back of his head his fingers came away bloody he tried to kill me s true i saw it one of the rapers put in he broke my wrist grenn said again holding it out to noye for inspection the armorer gave the offered wrist the briefest of glances a bruise perhaps a sprain maestor aemon will give you a salve go with him todder that head wants looking after the rest of you return to your cells not you snow you stay jon sat heavily on the long wooden bench as the others left oblivious to the looks they gave him the silent promises of future retribution his arm was throbbing the watch has need of every man it can get donal noye said when they were alone even men like toad you wont win any honors killing him jons anger flared he said my mother was a whore i heard him what of it lord eddard stark was not a man to sleep with whores jon said icily his honor did not prevent him from fathering a bastard did it jon was cold with rage can i go you go when i tell you to go jon stared sullenly at the smoke rising from the brazier until noye took him under the chin thick fingers twisting his head around look at me when im talking to you boy jon looked the armorer had a chest like a keg of ale and a gut to match his nose was flat and broad and he always seemed in need of a shave the left sleeve of his black wool tunic was fastened at the shoulder with a silver pin in the shape of a longsword words wont make your mother a whore she was what she was and nothing toad says can change that you know we have men on the wall whose mothers were whores not my mother jon thought stubbornly he knew nothing of his mother eddard stark would not talk of her yet he dreamed of her at times so often that he could almost see her face in his dreams she was beautiful and highborn and her eyes were kind you think you had it hard being a high lords bastard the armorer went on that boy jeren is a septons get and cotter pyke is the baseborn son of a tavern wench now he commands eastwatch by the sea i dont care jon said i dont care about them and i dont care about you or thorne or benjen stark or any of it i hate it here its too its cold yes cold and hard and mean thats the wall and the men who walk it not like the stories your wet nurse told you well piss on the stories and piss on your wet nurse this is the way it is and youre here for life same as the rest of us life jon repeated bitterly the armorer could talk about life hed had one hed only taken the black after hed lost an arm at the siege of storms end before that hed smithed for stannis baratheon the kings brother hed seen the seven kingdoms from one end to the other hed feasted and wenched and fought in a hundred battles they said it was donal noye whod forged king roberts warhammer the one that crushed the life from rhaegar targaryen on the trident hed done all the things that jon would never do and then when he was old well past thirty hed taken a glancing blow from an axe and the wound had festered until the whole arm had to come off only then crippled had donal noye come to the wall when his life was all but over yes life noye said a long life or a short one its up to you snow the road youre walking one of your brothers will slit your throat for you one night theyre not my brothers jon snapped they hate me because im better than they are no they hate you because you act like youre better than they are they look at you and see a castle bred bastard who thinks hes a lordling the armorer leaned close youre no lordling remember that youre a snow not a stark youre a bastard and a bully a bully jon almost choked on the word the accusation was so unjust it took his breath away they were the ones who came after me four of them four that youve humiliated in the yard four who are probably afraid of you ive watched you fight its not training with you put a good edge on your sword and theyd be dead meat you know it i know it they know it you leave them nothing you shame them does that make you proud jon hesitated he did feel proud when he won why shouldnt he but the armorer was taking that away too making it sound as if he were doing something wrong theyre all older than me he said defensively older and bigger and stronger thats the truth ill wager your master at arms taught you how to fight bigger men at winterfell though who was he some old knight ser rodrik cassel jon said warily there was a trap here he felt it closing around him donal noye leaned forward into jons face now think on this boy none of these others have ever had a master at arms until ser alliser their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers smiths and miners and oars on a trading galley what they know of fighting they learned between decks in the alleys of oldtown and lannisport in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad they may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here but i promise you not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword his look was grim so how do you like the taste of your victories now lord snow dont call me that jon said sharply but the force had gone out of his anger suddenly he felt ashamed and guilty i never i didnt think best you start thinking noye warned him that or sleep with a dagger by your bed now go by the time jon left the armory it was almost midday the sun had broken through the clouds he turned his back on it and lifted his eyes to the wall blazing blue and crystalline in the sunlight even after all these weeks the sight of it still gave him the shivers centuries of windblown dirt had pocked and scoured it covering it like a film and it often seemed a pale grey the color of an overcast sky but when the sun caught it fair on a bright day it shone alive with light a colossal blue white cliff that filled up half the sky the largest structure ever built by the hands of man benjen stark had told jon on the kingsroad when they had first caught sight of the wall in the distance and beyond a doubt the most useless tyrion lannister had added with a grin but even the imp grew silent as they rode closer you could see it from miles off a pale blue line across the northern horizon stretching away to the east and west and vanishing in the far distance immense and unbroken this is the end of the world it seemed to say when they finally spied castle black its timbered keeps and stone towers looked like nothing more than a handful of toy blocks scattered on the snow beneath the vast wall of ice the ancient stronghold of the black brothers was no winterfell no true castle at all lacking walls it could not be defended not from the south or east or west but it was only the north that concerned the nights watch and to the north loomed the wall almost seven hundred feet high it stood three times the height of the tallest tower in the stronghold it sheltered his uncle said the top was wide enough for a dozen armored knights to ride abreast the gaunt outlines of huge catapults and monstrous wooden cranes stood sentry up there like the skeletons of great birds and among them walked men in black as small as ants as he stood outside the armory looking up jon felt almost as overwhelmed as he had that day on the kingsroad when hed seen it for the first time the wall was like that sometimes he could almost forget that it was there the way you forgot about the sky or the earth underfoot but there were other times when it seemed as if there was nothing else in the world it was older than the seven kingdoms and when he stood beneath it and looked up it made jon dizzy he could feel the great weight of all that ice pressing down on him as if it were about to topple and somehow jon knew that if it fell the world fell with it makes you wonder what lies beyond a familiar voice said jon looked around lannister i didnt see i mean i thought i was alone tyrion lannister was bundled in furs so thickly he looked like a very small bear theres much to be said for taking people unawares you never know what you might learn you wont learn anything from me jon told him he had seen little of the dwarf since their journey ended as the queens own brother tyrion lannister had been an honored guest of the nights watch the lord commander had given him rooms in the kings tower so called though no king had visited it for a hundred yearsand lannister dined at mormonts own table and spent his days riding the wall and his nights dicing and drinking with ser alliser and bowen marsh and the other high officers oh i learn things everywhere i go the little man gestured up at the wall with a gnarled black walking stick as i was saying why is it that when one man builds a wall the next man immediately needs to know whats on the other side he cocked his head and looked at jon with his curious mismatched eyes you do want to know whats on the other side dont you its nothing special jon said he wanted to ride with benjen stark on his rangings deep into the mysteries of the haunted forest wanted to fight mance rayders wildlings and ward the realm against the others but it was better not to speak of the things you wanted the rangers say its just woods and mountains and frozen lakes with lots of snow and ice and the grumkins and the snarks tyrion said let us not forget them lord snow or else whats that big thing for dont call me lord snow the dwarf lifted an eyebrow would you rather be called the imp let them see that their words can cut you and youll never be free of the mockery if they want to give you a name take it make it your own then they cant hurt you with it anymore he gestured with his stick come walk with me theyll be serving some vile stew in the common hall by now and i could do with a bowl of something hot jon was hungry too so he fell in beside lannister and slowed his pace to match the dwarfs awkward waddling steps the wind was rising and they could hear the old wooden buildings creaking around them and in the distance a heavy shutter banging over and over forgotten once there was a muffled thump as a blanket of snow slid from a roof and landed near them i dont see your wolf lannister said as they walked i chain him up in the old stables when were training they board all the horses in the east stables now so no one bothers him the rest of the time he stays with me my sleeping cell is in hardins tower thats the one with the broken battlement no shattered stone in the yard below and a lean to it like our noble king robert after a long nights drinking i thought all those buildings had been abandoned jon shrugged no one cares where you sleep most of the old keeps are empty you can pick any cell you want once castle black had housed five thousand fighting men with all their horses and servants and weapons now it was home to a tenth that number and parts of it were falling into ruin tyrion lannisters laughter steamed in the cold air ill be sure to tell your father to arrest more stonemasons before your tower collapses jon could taste the mockery there but there was no denying the truth the watch had built nineteen great strongholds along the wall but only three were still occupied eastwatch on its grey windswept shore the shadow tower hard by the mountains where the wall ended and castle black between them at the end of the kingsroad the other keeps long deserted were lonely haunted places where cold winds whistled through black windows and the spirits of the dead manned the parapets its better that im by myself jon said stubbornly the rest of them are scared of ghost wise boys lannister said then he changed the subject the talk is your uncle is too long away jon remembered the wish hed wished in his anger the vision of benjen stark dead in the snow and he looked away quickly the dwarf had a way of sensing things and jon did not want him to see the guilt in his eyes he said hed be back by my name day he admitted his name day had come and gone unremarked a fortnight past they were looking for ser waymar royce his father is bannerman to lord arryn uncle benjen said they might search as far as the shadow tower thats all the way up in the mountains i hear that a good many rangers have vanished of late lannister said as they mounted the steps to the common hall he grinned and pulled open the door perhaps the grumkins are hungry this year inside the hall was immense and drafty even with a fire roaring in its great hearth crows nested in the timbers of its lofty ceiling jon heard their cries overhead as he accepted a bowl of stew and a heel of black bread from the days cooks grenn and toad and some of the others were seated at the bench nearest the warmth laughing and cursing each other in rough voices jon eyed them thoughtfully for a moment then he chose a spot at the far end of the hall well away from the other diners tyrion lannister sat across from him sniffing at the stew suspiciously barley onion carrot he muttered someone should tell the cooks that turnip isnt a meat its mutton stew jon pulled off his gloves and warmed his hands in the steam rising from the bowl the smell made his mouth water snow jon knew alliser thornes voice but there was a curious note in it that he had not heard before he turned the lord commander wants to see you now for a moment jon was too frightened to move why would the lord commander want to see him they had heard something about benjen he thought wildly he was dead the vision had come true is it my uncle he blurted is he returned safe the lord commander is not accustomed to waiting was ser allisers reply and i am not accustomed to having my commands questioned by bastards tyrion lannister swung off the bench and rose stop it thorne youre frightening the boy keep out of matters that dont concern you lannister you have no place here i have a place at court though the dwarf said smiling a word in the right ear and youll die a sour old man before you get another boy to train now tell snow why the old bear needs to see him is there news of his uncle no ser alliser said this is another matter entirely a bird arrived this morning from winterfell with a message that concerns his brother he corrected himself his half brother bran jon breathed scrambling to his feet somethings happened to bran tyrion lannister laid a hand on his arm jon he said i am truly sorry jon scarcely heard him he brushed off tyrions hand and strode across the hall he was running by the time he hit the doors he raced to the commanders keep dashing through drifts of old snow when the guards passed him he took the tower steps two at a time by the time he burst into the presence of the lord commander his boots were soaked and jon was wild eyed and panting bran he said what does it say about bran jeor mormont lord commander of the nights watch was a gruff old man with an immense bald head and a shaggy grey beard he had a raven on his arm and he was feeding it kernels of corn i am told you can read he shook the raven off and it flapped its wings and flew to the window where it sat watching as mormont drew a roll of paper from his belt and handed it to jon com it muttered in a raucous voice com com jons finger traced the outline of the direwolf in the white wax of the broken seat he recognized robbs hand but the letters seemed to blur and run as he tried to read them he realized he was crying and then through the tears he found the sense in the words and raised his head he woke up he said the gods gave him back crippled mormont said im sorry boy read the rest of the letter he looked at the words but they didnt matter nothing mattered bran was going to live my brother is going to live he told mormont the lord commander shook his head gathered up a fistful of corn and whistled the raven flew to his shoulder crying live live jon ran down the stairs a smile on his face and robbs letter in his hand my brother is going to live he told the guards they exchanged a look he ran back to the common hall where he found tyrion lannister just finishing his meal he grabbed the little man under the arms hoisted him up in the air and spun him around in a circle bran is going to live he whooped lannister looked startled jon put him down and thrust the paper into his hands here read it he said others were gathering around and looking at him curiously jon noticed grenn a few feet away a thick woolen bandage was wrapped around one hand he looked anxious and uncomfortable not menacing at all jon went to him grenn edged backward and put up his hands stay away from me now you bastard jon smiled at him im sorry about your wrist robb used the same move on me once only with a wooden blade it hurt like seven hells but yours must be worse look if you want i can show you how to defend that alliser thorne overheard him lord snow wants to take my place now he sneered id have an easier time teaching a wolf to juggle than you will training this aurochs ill take that wager ser alliser jon said id love to see ghost juggle jon heard grenn suck in his breath shocked silence fell then tyrion lannister guffawed three of the black brothers joined in from a nearby table the laughter spread up and down the benches until even the cooks joined in the birds stirred in the rafters and finally even grenn began to chuckle ser alliser never took his eyes from jon as the laughter rolled around him his face darkened and his sword hand curled into a fist that was a grievous error lord snow he said at last in the acid tones of an enemy eddard eddard stark rode through the towering bronze doors of the red keep sore tired hungry and irritable he was still a horse dreaming of a long hot soak a roast fowl and a featherbed when the kings steward told him that grand maester pycelle had convened an urgent meeting of the small council the honor of the hands presence was requested as soon as it was convenient it will be convenient on the morrow ned snapped as he dismounted the steward bowed very low i shall give the councillors your regrets my lord no damn it ned said it would not do to offend the council before he had even begun i will see them pray give me a few moments to change into something more presentable yes my lord the steward said we have given you lord arryns former chambers in the tower of the hand if it please you i shall have your things taken there my thanks ned said as he ripped off his riding gloves and tucked them into his belt the rest of his household was coming through the gate behind him ned saw vayon poole his own steward and called out it seems the council has urgent need of me see that my daughters find their bedchambers and tell jory to keep them there arya is not to go exploring poole bowed ned turned back to the royal steward my wagons are still straggling through the city i shall need appropriate garments it will be my great pleasure the steward said and so ned had come striding into the council chambers bonetired and dressed in borrowed clothing to find four members of the small council waiting for him the chamber was richly furnished myrish carpets covered the floor instead of rushes and in one corner a hundred fabulous beasts cavorted in bright paints on a carved screen from the summer isles the walls were hung with tapestries from norvos and qohor and lys and a pair of valyrian sphinxes flanked the door eyes of polished garnet smoldering in black marble faces the councillor ned liked least the eunuch varys accosted him the moment he entered lord stark i was grievous sad to hear about your troubles on the kingsroad we have all been visiting the sept to light candles for prince joffrey i pray for his recovery his hand left powder stains on neds sleeve and he smelled as foul and sweet as flowers on a grave your gods have heard you ned replied cool yet polite the prince grows stronger every day he disentangled himself from the eunuchs grip and crossed the room to where lord renly stood by the screen talking quietly with a short man who could only be littlefinger renly had been a boy of eight when robert won the throne but he had grown into a man so like his brother that ned found it disconcerting whenever he saw him it was as if the years had slipped away and robert stood before him fresh from his victory on the trident i see you have arrived safely lord stark renly said and you as well ned replied you must forgive me but sometimes you look the very image of your brother robert a poor copy renly said with a shrug though much better dressed littlefinger quipped lord renly spends more on clothing than half the ladies of the court it was true enough lord renly was in dark green velvet with a dozen golden stags embroidered on his doublet a cloth of gold half cape was draped casually across one shoulder fastened with an emerald brooch there are worse crimes renly said with a laugh the wayyou dress for one littlefinger ignored the jibe he eyed ned with a smile on his lips that bordered on insolence i have hoped to meet you for some years lord stark no doubt lady catelyn has mentioned me to you she has ned replied with a chill in his voice the sly arrogance of the comment rankled him i understand you knew my brother brandon as well renly baratheon laughed varys shuffled over to listen rather too well littlefinger said i still carry a token of his esteem did brandon speak of me too often and with some heat ned said hoping that would end it he had no patience with this game they played this dueling with words i should have thought that heat ill suits you starks littlefinger said here in the south they say you are all made of ice and melt when you ride below the neck i do not plan on melting soon lord baelish you may count on it ned moved to the council table and said maester pycelle i trust you are well the grand maester smiled gently from his tall chair at the foot of the table well enough for a man of my years my lord he replied yet i do tire easily i fear wispy strands of white hair fringed the broad bald dome of his forehead above a kindly face his maesters collar was no simple metal choker such as luwin wore but two dozen heavy chains wound together into a ponderous metal necklace that covered him from throat to breast the links were forged of every metal known to man black iron and red gold bright copper and dull lead steel and tin and pale silver brass and bronze and platinum garnets and amethysts and black pearls adorned the metalwork and here and there an emerald or ruby perhaps we might begin soon the grand maester said hands knitting together atop his broad stomach i fear i shall fall asleep if we wait much longer as you will the kings seat sat empty at the head of the table the crowned stag of baratheon embroidered in gold thread on its pillows ned took the chair beside it as the right hand of his king my lords he said formally i am sorry to have kept you waiting you are the kings hand varys said we serve at your pleasure lord stark as the others took their accustomed seats it struck eddard stark forcefully that he did not belong here in this room with these men he remembered what robert had told him in the crypts below winterfell i am surrounded by flatterers andfools the king had insisted ned looked down the council table and wondered which were the flatterers and which the fools he thought he knew already we are but five he pointed out lord stannis took himself to dragonstone not long after the king went north varys said and our gallant ser barristan no doubt rides beside the king as he makes his way through the city as befits the lord commander of the kingsguard perhaps we had best wait for ser barristan and the king to join us ned suggested renly baratheon laughed aloud if we wait for my brother to grace us with his royal presence it could be a long sit our good king robert has many cares varys said he entrusts some small matters to us to lighten his load what lord varys means is that all this business of coin and crops and justice bores my royal brother to tears lord renly said so it falls to us to govern the realm he does send us a command from time to time he drew a tightly rolled paper from his sleeve and laid it on the table this morning he commanded me to ride ahead with all haste and ask grand maester pycelle to convene this council at once he has an urgent task for us littlefinger smiled and handed the paper to ned it bore the royal seal ned broke the wax with his thumb and flattened the letter to consider the kings urgent command reading the words with mounting disbelief was there no end to roberts folly and to do this in his name that was salt in the wound gods be good he swore what lord eddard means to say lord renly announced is that his grace instructs us to stage a great tournament in honor of his appointment as the hand of the king how much asked littlefinger mildly ned read the answer off the letter forty thousand golden dragons to the champion twenty thousand to the man who comes second another twenty to the winner of the melee and ten thousand to the victor of the archery competition ninety thousand gold pieces littlefinger sighed and we must not neglect the other costs robert will want a prodigious feast that means cooks carpenters serving girls singers jugglers fools fools we have in plenty lord renly said grand maester pycelle looked to littlefinger and asked will the treasury bear the expense what treasury is that littlefinger replied with a twist of his mouth spare me the foolishness maester you know as well as i that the treasury has been empty for years i shall have to borrow the money no doubt the lannisters will be accommodating we owe lord tywin some three million dragons at present what matter another hundred thousand ned was stunned are you claiming that the crown is three million gold pieces in debt the crown is more than six million gold pieces in debt lord stark the lannisters are the biggest part of it but we have also borrowed from lord tyrell the iron bank of braavos and several tyroshi trading cartels of late ive had to turn to the faith the high septon haggles worse than a dornish fishmonger ned was aghast aerys targaryen left a treasury flowing with gold how could you let this happen littlefinger gave a shrug the master of coin finds the money the king and the hand spend it i will not believe that jon arryn allowed robert to beggar the realm ned said hotly grand maester pycelle shook his great bald head his chains clinking softly lord arryn was a prudent man but i fear that his grace does not always listen to wise counsel my royal brother loves tournaments and feasts renly baratheon said and he loathes what he calls counting coppers i will speak with his grace ned said this tourney is an extravagance the realm cannot afford speak to him as you will lord renly said we had still best make our plans another day ned said perhaps too sharply from the looks they gave him he would have to remember that he was no longer in winterfell where only the king stood higher here he was but first among equals forgive me my lords he said in a softer tone i am tired let us call a halt for today and resume when we are fresher he did not ask for their consent but stood abruptly nodded at them all and made for the door outside wagons and riders were still pouring through the castle gates and the yard was a chaos of mud and horseflesh and shouting men the king had not yet arrived he was told since the ugliness on the trident the starks and their household had ridden well ahead of the main column the better to separate themselves from the lannisters and the growing tension robert had hardly been seen the talk was he was traveling in the huge wheelhouse drunk as often as not if so he might be hours behind but he would still be here too soon for neds liking he had only to look at sansas face to feel the rage twisting inside him once again the last fortnight of their journey had been a misery sansa blamed arya and told her that it should have been nymeria who died and arya was lost after she heard what had happened to her butchers boy sansa cried herself to sleep arya brooded silently all day long and eddard stark dreamed of a frozen hell reserved for the starks of winterfell he crossed the outer yard passed under a portcullis into the inner bailey and was walking toward what he thought was the tower of the hand when littlefinger appeared in front of him youre going the wrong way stark come with me hesitantly ned followed littlefinger led him into a tower down a stair across a small sunken courtyard and along a deserted corridor where empty suits of armor stood sentinel along the walls they were relics of the targaryens black steel with dragon scales cresting their helms now dusty and forgotten this is not the way to my chambers ned said did i say it was im leading you to the dungeons to slit your throat and seal your corpse up behind a wall littlefinger replied his voice dripping with sarcasm we have no time for this stark your wife awaits what game are you playing littlefinger catelyn is at winterfell hundreds of leagues from here oh littlefingers grey green eyes glittered with amusement then it appears someone has managed an astonishing impersonation for the last time come or dont come and ill keep her for myself he hurried down the steps ned followed him warily wondering if this day would ever end he had no taste for these intrigues but he was beginning to realize that they were meat and mead to a man like littlefinger at the foot of the steps was a heavy door of oak and iron petyr baelish lifted the crossbar and gestured ned through they stepped out into the ruddy glow of dusk on a rocky bluff high above the river were outside the castle ned said you are a hard man to fool stark littlefinger said with a smirk was it the sun that gave it away or the sky follow me there are niches cut in the rock try not to fall to your death catelyn would never understand with that he was over the side of the cliff descending as quick as a monkey ned studied the rocky face of the bluff for a moment then followed more slowly the niches were there as littlefinger had promised shallow cuts that would be invisible from below unless you knew just where to look for them the river was a long dizzying distance below ned kept his face pressed to the rock and tried not to look down any more often than he had to when at last he reached the bottom a narrow muddy trail along the waters edge littlefinger was lazing against a rock and eating an apple he was almost down to the core you are growing old and slow stark he said flipping the apple casually into the rushing water a game of thronls no matter we ride the rest of the way he had two horses waiting ned mounted up and trotted behind him down the trail and into the city finally baelish drew rein in front of a ramshackle building three stories timbered its windows bright with lamplight in the gathering dusk the sounds of music and raucous laughter drifted out and floated over the water beside the door swung an ornate oil lamp on a heavy chain with a globe of leaded red glass ned stark dismounted in a fury a brothel he said as he seized littlefinger by the shoulder and spun him around youve brought me all this way to take me to a brothel your wife is inside littlefinger said it was the final insult brandon was too kind to you ned said as he slammed the small man back against a wall and shoved his dagger up under the little pointed chin beard my lord no an urgent voice called out he speaks the truth there were footsteps behind him ned spun knife in hand as an old white haired man hurried toward them he was dressed in brown roughspun and the soft flesh under his chin wobbled as he ran this is no business of yours ned began then suddenly the recognition came he lowered the dagger astonished ser rodfik rodrik cassel nodded your lady awaits you upstairs ned was lost catelyn is truly here this is not some strange jape of littlefingers he sheathed his blade would that it were stark littlefinger said follow me and try to look a shade more lecherous and a shade less like the kings hand it would not do to have you recognized perhaps you could fondle a breast or two just in passing they went inside through a crowded common room where a fat woman was singing bawdy songs while pretty young girls in linen shifts and wisps of colored silk pressed themselves against their lovers and dandled on their laps no one paid ned the least bit of attention ser rodrik waited below while littlefinger led him up to the third floor along a corridor and through a door inside catelyn was waiting she cried out when she saw him ran to him and embraced him fiercely my lady ned whispered in wonderment oh very good said littlefinger closing the door you recognized her i feared youd never come my lord she whispered against his chest petyr has been bringing me reports he told me of your troubles with arya and the young prince how are my girls both in mourning and full of anger he told her cat i do not understand what are you doing in kings landing whats happened ned asked his wife is it bran is he dead was the word that came to his lips but he could not say it it is bran but not as you think catelyn said ned was lost then how why are you here my love what is this place just what it appears littlefinger said easing himself onto a window seat a brothel can you think of a less likely place to find a catelyn tully he smiled as it chances i own this particular establishment so arrangements were easily made i am most anxious to keep the lannisters from learning that cat is here in kings landing why ned asked he saw her hands then the awkward way she held them the raw red scars the stiffness of the last two fingers on her left youve been hurt he took her hands in his own turned them over gods those are deep cuts a gash from a sword or how did this happen my lady catelyn slid a dagger out from under her cloak and placed it in his hand this blade was sent to open brans throat and spill his lifes blood neds head jerked up but who why would she put a finger to his lips let me tell it all my love it will go faster that way listen so he listened and she told it all from the fire in the library tower to varys and the guardsmen and littlefinger and when she was done eddard stark sat dazed beside the table the dagger in his hand brans wolf had saved the boys life he thought dully what was it that jon had said when they found the pups in the snow your children were meant to have these pups my lord and he had killed sansas and for what was it guilt he was feeling or fear if the gods had sent these wolves what folly had he done painfully ned forced his thoughts back to the dagger and what it meant the imps dagger he repeated it made no sense his hand curled around the smooth dragonbone hilt and he slammed the blade into the table felt it bite into the wood it stood mocking him why should tyrion lannister want bran dead the boy has never done him harm do you starks have nought but snow between your ears littlefinger asked the imp would never have acted alone ned rose and paced the length of the room if the queen had a role in this or gods forbid the king himself no i will not believe that yet even as he said the words he remembered that chill morning on the barrowlands and roberts talk of sending hired knives after the targaryen princess he remembered rhaegars infant son the red ruin of his skull and the way the king had turned away as he had turned away in darrys audience hall not so long ago he could still hear sansa pleading as lyanna had pleaded once most likely the king did not know littlefinger said it would not be the first time our good robert is practiced at closing his eyes to things he would rather not see ned had no reply for that the face of the butchers boy swam up before his eyes cloven almost in two and afterward the king had said not a word his head was pounding littlefinger sauntered over to the table wrenched the knife from the wood the accusation is treason either way accuse the king and you will dance with ilyn payne before the words are out of your mouth the queen if you can find proof and if you can make robert listen then perhaps we have proof ned said we have the dagger this littlefinger flipped the knife casually end over end a sweet piece of steel but it cuts two ways my lord the imp will no doubt swear the blade was lost or stolen while he was at winterfell and with his hireling dead who is there to give him the lie he tossed the knife lightly to ned my counsel is to drop that in the river and forget that it was ever forged ned regarded him coldly lord baelish i am a stark of winterfell my son lies crippled perhaps dying he would be dead and catelyn with him but for a wolf pup we found in the snow if you truly believe i could forget that you are as big a fool now as when you took up sword against my brother a fool i may be stark yet im still here while your brother has been moldering in his frozen grave for some fourteen years now if you are so eager to molder beside him far be it from me to dissuade you but i would rather not be included in the party thank you very much you would be the last man i would willingly include in any party lord baelish you wound me deeply littlefinger placed a hand over his heart for my part i always found you starks a tiresome lot but cat seems to have become attached to you for reasons i cannot comprehend i shall try to keep you alive for her sake a fools task admittedly but i could never refuse your wife anything littlefinger i should warn you stark we usually charge for that sort of thing around here a moment alone thats all i ask catelyn said very well littlefinger strolled to the door dont be too long it is past time the hand and i returned to the castle before our absence is noted catelyn went to him and took his hands in her own i will not forget the help you gave me petyr when your men came for me i did not know whether they were taking me to a friend or an enemy i have found you more than a friend i have found a brother id thought lost petyr baelish smiled i am desperately sentimental sweet lady best not tell anyone i have spent years convincing the court that i am wicked and cruel and i should hate to see all that hard work go for naught ned believed not a word of that but he kept his voice polite as he said you have my thanks as well lord baelish oh now theres a treasure littlefinger said exiting when the door had closed behind him ned turned back to his wife once you are home send word to helman tallhart and galbart glover under my seal they are to raise a hundred bowmen each and fortify moat cailin two hundred determined archers can hold the neck against an army instruct lord manderly that he is to strengthen and repair all his defenses at white harbor and see that they are well manned and from this day on i want a careful watch kept over theon greyjoy if there is war we shall have sore need of his fathers fleet war the fear was plain on catelyns face it will not come to that ned promised her praying it was true he took her in his arms again the lannisters are merciless in the face of weakness as aerys targaryen learned to his sorrow but they would not dare attack the north without all the power of the realm behind them and that they shall not have i must play out this fools masquerade as if nothing is amiss remember why i came here my love if i find proof that the lannisters murdered jon arryn he felt catelyn tremble in his arms her scarred hands clung to him if she said what then my love that was the most dangerous part ned knew all justice flows from the king he told her when i know the truth i must go to robert and pray that he is the man i think he is he finished silently and not the man i fear he has become tyrion are you certain that you must leave us so soon the lord commander asked him past certain lord mormont tyrion replied my brother jaime will be wondering what has become of me he may decide that you have convinced me to take the black would that i could mormont picked up a crab claw and cracked it in his fist old as he was the lord commander still had the strength of a bear youre a cunning man tyrion we have need of men of your sort on the wall tyrion grinned then i shall scour the seven kingdoms for dwarfs and ship them all to you lord mormont as they laughed he sucked the meat from a crab leg and reached for another the crabs had arrived from eastwatch only this morning packed in a barrel of snow and they were succulent ser alliser thorne was the only man at table who did not so much as crack a smile lannister mocks us only you ser alliser tyrion said this time the laughter round the table had a nervous uncertain quality to it thornes black eyes fixed on tyrion with loathing you have a bold tongue for someone who is less than half a man perhaps you and i should visit the yard together why asked tyrion the crabs are here the remark brought more guffaws from the others ser alliser stood up his mouth a tight line come and make your j apes with steel in your hand tyrion looked pointedly at his right hand why i have steel in my hand ser alliser although it appears to be a crab fork shall we duel he hopped up on his chair and began poking at thornes chest with the tiny fork roars of laughter filled the tower room bits of crab flew from the lord commanders mouth as he began to gasp and choke even his raven joined in cawing loudly from above the window duel duel duel ser alliser thorne walked from the room so stiffly it looked as though he had a dagger up his butt mormont was still gasping for breath tyrion pounded him on the back to the victor goes the spoils he called out i claim thornes share of the crabs finally the lord commander recovered himself you are a wicked man to provoke our ser alliser so he scolded tyrion seated himself and took a sip of wine if a man paints a target on his chest he should expect that sooner or later someone will loose an arrow at him i have seen dead men with more humor than your ser alliser not so objected the lord steward bowen marsh a man as round and red as a pomegranate you ought to hear the droll names he gives the lads he trains tyrion had heard a few of those droll names ill wager the lads have a few names for him as well he said chip the ice off your eyes my good lords ser alliser thorne should be mucking out your stables not drilling your young warriors the watch has no shortage of stableboys lord mormont grumbled that seems to be all they send us these days stableboys and sneak thieves and rapers ser alliser is an anointed knight one of the few to take the black since i have been lord commander he fought bravely at kings landing on the wrong side ser jaremy rykker commented dryly i ought to know i was there on the battlements beside him tywin lannister gave us a splendid choice take the black or see our heads on spikes before evenfall no offense intended tyrion none taken ser jaremy my father is very fond of spiked heads especially those of people who have annoyed him in some fashion and a face as noble as yours well no doubt he saw you decorating the city wall above the kings gate i think you would have looked very striking up there thank you ser jaremy replied with a sardonic smile lord commander mormont cleared his throat sometimes i fear ser alliser saw you true tyrion you do mock us and our noble purpose here tyrion shrugged we all need to be mocked from time to time lord mormont lest we start to take ourselves too seriously more wine please he held out his cup as rykker filled it for him bowen marsh said you have a great thirst for a small man oh i think that lord tyrion is quite a large man maester aemon said from the far end of the table he spoke softly yet the high officers of the nights watch all fell quiet the better to hear what the ancient had to say i think he is a giant come among us here at the end of the world tyrion answered gently ive been called many things my lord but giant is seldom one of them nonetheless maester aemon said as his clouded milk white eyes moved to tyrions face i think it is true for once tyrion lannister found himself at a loss for words he could only bow his head politely and say you are too kind maester aemon the blind man smiled he was a tiny thing wrinkled and hairless shrunken beneath the weight of a hundred years so his maesters collar with its links of many metals hung loose about his throat i have been called many things my lord he said but kind is seldom one of them this time tyrion himself led the laughter much later when the serious business of eating was done and the others had left mormont offered tyrion a chair beside the fire and a cup of mulled spirits so strong they brought tears to his eyes the kingsroad can be perilous this far north the lord commander told him as they drank i have jyck and morrec tyrion said and yoren is riding south again yoren is only one man the watch shall escort you as far as winterfell mormont announced in a tone that brooked no argument three men should be sufficient if you insist my lord tyrion said you might send young snow he would be glad for a chance to see his brothers mormont frowned through his thick grey beard snow oh the stark bastard i think not the young ones need to forget the lives they left behind them the brothers and mothers and all that a visit home would only stir up feelings best left alone i know these things my own blood kin my sister maege rules bear island now since my sons dishonor i have nieces i have never seen he took a swallow besides jon snow is only a boy you shall have three strong swords to keep you safe i am touched by your concern lord mormont the strong drink was making tyrion light headed but not so drunk that he did not realize that the old bear wanted something from him i hope i can repay your kindness you can mormont said bluntly your sister sits beside the king your brother is a great knight and your father the most powerful lord in the seven kingdoms speak to them for us tell them of our need here you have seen for yourself my lord the nights watch is dying our strength is less than a thousand now six hundred here two hundred in the shadow tower even fewer at eastwatch and a scant third of those fighting men the wall is a hundred leagues long think on that should an attack come i have three men to defend each mile of wall three and a third tyrion said with a yawn mormont scarcely seemed to hear him the old man warmed his hands before the fire i sent benjen stark to search after yohn royces son lost on his first ranging the royce boy was green as summer grass yet he insisted on the honor of his own command saying it was his due as a knight i did not wish to offend his lord father so i yielded i sent him out with two men i deemed as good as any in the watch more fool u fool the raven agreed tyrion glanced up the bird peered down at him with those beady black eyes ruffling its wings fool it called again doubtless old mormont would take it amiss if he throttled the creature a pity the lord commander took no notice of the irritating bird gared was near as old as i am and longer on the wall he went on yet it would seem he forswore himself and fled i should never have believed it not of him but lord eddard sent me his head from winterfell of royce there is no word one deserter and two men lost and now ben stark too has gone missing he sighed deeply who am i to send searching after him in two years i will be seventy too old and too weary for the burden i bear yet if i set it down who will pick it up alliser thorne bowen marsh i would have to be as blind as maester aemon not to see what they are the nights watch has become an army of sullen boys and tired old men apart from the men at my table tonight i have perhaps twenty who can read and even fewer who can think or plan or lead once the watch spent its summers building and each lord commander raised the wall higher than he found it now it is all we can do to stay alive he was in deadly earnest tyrion realized he felt faintly embarrassed for the old man lord mormont had spent a good part of his life on the wall and he needed to believe if those years were to have any meaning i promise the king will hear of your need tyrion said gravely and i will speak to my father and my brother jaime as well and he would tyrion lannister was as good as his word he left the rest unsaid that king robert would ignore him lord tywin would ask if he had taken leave of his senses and jaime would only laugh you are a young man tyrion mormont said how many winters have you seen he shrugged eight nine i misremember and all of them short as you say my lord he had been born in the dead of winter a terrible cruel one that the maesters said had lasted near three years but tyrions earliest memories were of spring when i was a boy it was said that a long summer always meant a long winter to come this summer has lasted nine years tyrion and a tenth will soon be upon us think on that when i was a boy tyrion replied my wet nurse told me that one day if men were good the gods would give the world a summer without ending perhaps weve been better than we thought and the great summer is finally at hand he grinned the lord commander did not seem amused you are not fool enough to believe that my lord already the days grow shorter there can be no mistake aemon has had letters from the citadel findings in accord with his own the end of summer stares us in the face mormont reached out and clutched tyrion tightly by the hand you must make them understand i tell you my lord the darkness is coming there are wild things in the woods direwolves and mammoths and snow bears the size of aurochs and i have seen darker shapes in my dreams in your dreams tyrion echoed thinking how badly he needed another strong drink mormont was deaf to the edge in his voice the fisherfolk near eastwatch have glimpsed white walkers on the shore this time tyrion could not hold his tongue the fisherfolk of lannisport often glimpse merlings denys mallister writes that the mountain people are moving south slipping past the shadow tower in numbers greater than ever before they are running my lord but running from what lord mormont moved to the window and stared out into the night these are old bones lannister but they have never felt a chill like this tell the king what i say i pray you winter is coming and when the long night falls only the nights watch will stand between the realm and the darkness that sweeps from the north the gods help us all if we are not ready the gods help me if i do not get some sleep tonight yoren is determined to ride at first light tyrion got to his feet sleepy from wine and tired of doom i thank you for all the courtesies you have done me lord mormont tell them tyrion tell them and make them believe that is all the thanks i need he whistled and his raven flew to him and perched on his shoulder mormont smiled and gave the bird some corn from his pocket and that was how tyrion left him it was bitter cold outside bundled thickly in his furs tyrion lannister pulled on his gloves and nodded to the poor frozen wretches standing sentry outside the commanders keep he set off across the yard for his own chambers in the kings tower walking as briskly as his legs could manage patches of snow crunched beneath his feet as his boots broke the nights crust and his breath steamed before him like a banner he shoved his hands into his armpits and walked faster praying that morrec had remembered to warm his bed with hot bricks from the fire behind the kings tower the wall glimmered in the light of the moon immense and mysterious tyrion stopped for a moment to look up at it his legs ached of cold and haste suddenly a strange madness took hold of him a yearning to look once more off the end of the world it would be his last chance he thought tomorrow he would ride south and he could not imagine why he would ever want to return to this frozen desolation the kings tower was before him with its promise of warmth and a soft bed yet tyrion found himself walking past it toward the vast pale palisade of the wall a wooden stair ascended the south face anchored on huge roughhewn beams sunk deep into the ice and frozen in place back and forth it switched clawing its way upward as crooked as a bolt of lightning the black brothers assured him that it was much stronger than it looked but tyrions legs were cramping too badly for him to even contemplate the ascent he went instead to the iron cage beside the well clambered inside and yanked hard on the bell rope three quick pulls he had to wait what seemed an eternity standing there inside the bars with the wall to his back long enough for tyrion to begin to wonder why he was doing this he had just about decided to forget his sudden whim and go to bed when the cage gave a jerk and began to ascend he moved upward slowly by fits and starts at first then more smoothly the ground fell away beneath him the cage swung and tyrion wrapped his hands around the iron bars he could feel the cold of the metal even through his gloves morrec had a fire burning in his room he noted with approval but the lord commanders tower was dark the old bear had more sense than he did it seemed then he was above the towers still inching his way upward castle black lay below him etched in moonlight you could see how stark and empty it was from up here windowless keeps crumbling walls courtyards choked with broken stone farther off he could see the lights of moles town the little village half a league south along the kingsroad and here and there the bright glitter of moonlight on water where icy streams descended from the mountain heights to cut across the plains the rest of the world was a bleak emptiness of windswept hills and rocky fields spotted with snow finally a thick voice behind him said seven hells its the dwarf and the cage jerked to a sudden stop and hung there swinging slowly back and forth the ropes creaking bring him in damn it there was a grunt and a loud groaning of wood as the cage slid sideways and then the wall was beneath him tyrion waited until the swinging had stopped before he pushed open the cage door and hopped down onto the ice a heavy figure in black was leaning on the winch while a second held the cage with a gloved hand their faces were muffled in woolen scarves so only their eyes showed and they were plump with layers of wool and leather black on black and what will you be wanting this time of night the one by the winch asked a last look the men exchanged sour glances look all you want the other one said just have a care you dont fall off little man the old bear would have our hides a small wooden shack stood under the great crane and tyrion saw the dull glow of a brazier and felt a brief gust of warmth when the winch men opened the door and went back inside and then he was alone it was bitingly cold up here and the wind pulled at his clothes like an insistent lover the top of the wall was wider than the kingsroad often was so tyrion had no fear of falling although the footing was slicker than he would have liked the brothers spread crushed stone across the walkways but the weight of countless footsteps would melt the wall beneath so the ice would seem to grow around the gravel swallowing it until the path was bare again and it was time to crush more stone still it was nothing that tyrion could not manage he looked off to the east and west at the wall stretching before him a vast white road with no beginning and no end and a dark abyss on either side west he decided for no special reason and he began to walk that way following the pathway nearest the north edge where the gravel looked freshest his bare cheeks were ruddy with the cold and his legs complained more loudly with every step but tyrion ignored them the wind swirled around him gravel crunched beneath his boots while ahead the white ribbon followed the lines of the hills rising higher and higher until it was lost beyond the western horizon he passed a massive catapult as tall as a city wall its base sunk deep into the wall the throwing arm had been taken off for repairs and then forgotten it lay there like a broken toy half embedded in the ice on the far side of the catapult a muffled voice called out a challenge who goes there halt tyrion stopped if i halt too long ill freeze in place jon he said as a shaggy pale shape slid toward him silently and sniffed at his furs hello ghost jon snow moved closer he looked bigger and heavier in his layers of fur and leather the hood of his cloak pulled down over his face lannister he said yanking loose the scarf to uncover his mouth this is the last place i would have expected to see you he carried a heavy spear tipped in iron taller than he was and a sword hung at his side in a leather sheath across his chest was a gleaming black warhorn banded with silver this is the last place i would have expected to be seen tyrion admitted i was captured by a whim if i touch ghost will he chew my hand off not with me here jon promised tyrion scratched the white wolf behind the ears the red eyes watched him impassively the beast came up as high as his chest now another year and tyrion had the gloomy feeling hed be looking up at him what are you doing up here tonight he asked besides freezing your manhood off i have drawn night guard jon said again ser alliser has kindly arranged for the watch commander to take a special interest in me he seems to think that if they keep me awake half the night ill fall asleep during morning drill so far i have disappointed him tyrion grinned and has ghost learned to juggle yet no said jon smiling but grenn held his own against halder this morning and pyp is no longer dropping his sword quite so often as he did pyp pypar is his real name the small boy with the large ears he saw me working with grenn and asked for help thorne had never even shown him the proper way to grip a sword he turned to look north i have a mile of wall to guard will you walk with me if you walk slowly tyrion said the watch commander tells me i must walk to keep my blood from freezing but he never said how fast they walked with ghost pacing along beside jon like a white shadow i leave on the morrow tyrion said i know jon sounded strangely sad i plan to stop at winterfell on the way south if there is any message that you would like me to deliver tell robb that im going to command the nights watch and keep him safe so he might as well take up needlework with the girls and have mikken melt down his sword for horseshoes your brother is bigger than me tyrion said with a laugh i decline to deliver any message that might get me killed rickon will ask when im coming home try to explain where ive gone if you can tell him he can have all my things while im away hell like that people seemed to be asking a great deal of him today tyrion lannister thought you could put all this in a letter you know rickon cant read yet bran he stopped suddenly i dont know what message to send to bran help him tyrion what help could i give him i am no maester to ease his pain i have no spells to give him back his legs you gave me help when i needed it jon snow said i gave you nothing tyrion said words then give your words to bran too youre asking a lame man to teach a cripple how to dance tyrion said however sincere the lesson the result is likely to be grotesque still i know what it is to love a brother lord snow i will give bran whatever small help is in my power thank you my lord of lannister he pulled off his glove and offered his bare hand friend tyrion found himself oddly touched most of my kin are bastards he said with a wry smile but youre the first ive had to friend he pulled a glove off with his teeth and clasped snow by the hand flesh against flesh the boys grip was firm and strong when he had donned his glove again jon snow turned abruptly and walked to the low icy northern parapet beyond him the wall fell away sharply beyond him there was only the darkness and the wild tyrion followed him and side by side they stood upon the edge of the world the nights watch permitted the forest to come no closer than half a mile of the north face of the wall the thickets of ironwood and sentinel and oak that had once grown there had been harvested centuries ago to create a broad swath of open ground through which no enemy could hope to pass unseen tyrion had heard that elsewhere along the wall between the three fortresses the wildwood had come creeping back over the decades that there were places where greygreen sentinels and pale white weirwoods had taken root in the shadow of the wall itself but castle black had a prodigious appetite for firewood and here the forest was still kept at bay by the axes of the black brothers it was never far though from up here tyrion could see it the dark trees looming beyond the stretch of open ground like a second wall built parallel to the first a wall of night few axes had ever swung in that black wood where even the moonlight could not penetrate the ancient tangle of root and thorn and grasping limb out there the trees grew huge and the rangers said they seemed to brood and knew not men it was small wonder the nights watch named it the haunted forest as he stood there and looked at all that darkness with no fires burning anywhere with the wind blowing and the cold like a spear in his guts tyrion lannister felt as though he could almost believe the talk of the others the enemy in the night his jokes of grumkins and snarks no longer seemed quite so droll my uncle is out there jon snow said softly leaning on his spear as he stared off into the darkness the first night they sent me up here i thought uncle benjen will ride back tonight and ill see him first and blow the horn he never came though not that night and not any night give him time tyrion said far off to the north a wolf began to howl another voice picked up the call then another ghost cocked his head and listened if he doesnt come back jon snow promised ghost and i will go find him he put his hand on the direwolfs head i believe you tyrion said but what he thought was and who will go find you he shivered arya her father had been fighting with the council again arya could see it on his face when he came to table late again as he had been so often the first course a thick sweet soup made with pumpkins had already been taken away when ned stark strode into the small hall they called it that to set it apart from the great hall where the king could feast a thousand but it was a long room with a high vaulted ceiling and bench space for two hundred at its trestle tables my lord jory said when father entered he rose to his feet and the rest of the guard rose with him each man wore a new cloak heavy grey wool with a white satin border a hand of beaten silver clutched the woolen folds of each cloak and marked their wearers as men of the hands household guard there were only fifty of them so most of the benches were empty be seated eddard stark said i see you have started without me i am pleased to know there are still some men of sense in this city he signaled for the meal to resume the servants began bringing out platters of ribs roasted in a crust of garlic and herbs the talk in the yard is we shall have a tourney my lord jory said as he resumed his seat they say that knights will come from all over the realm to joust and feast in honor of your appointment as hand of the king arya could see that her father was not very happy about that do they also say this is the last thing in the world i would have wished sansas eyes had grown wide as the plates a tourney she breathed she was seated between septa mordane and jeyne poole as far from arya as she could get without drawing a reproach from father will we be permitted to go father you know my feelings sansa it seems i must arrange roberts games and pretend to be honored for his sake that does not mean i must subject my daughters to this folly oh please sansa said i want to see septa mordane spoke up princess myrcella will be there my lord and her younger than lady sansa all the ladies of the court will be expected at a grand event like this and as the tourney is in your honor it would look queer if your family did not attend father looked pained i suppose so very well i shall arrange a place for you sansa he saw arya for both of you i dont care about their stupid tourney arya said she knew prince jofftey would be there and she hated prince joffrey sansa lifted her head it will be a splendid event you shant be wanted anger flashed across fathers face enough sansa more of that and you will change my mind i am weary unto death of this endless war you two are fighting you are sisters i expect you to behave like sisters is that understood sansa bit her lip and nodded arya lowered her face to stare sullenly at her plate she could feel tears stinging her eyes she rubbed them away angrily determined not to cry the only sound was the clatter of knives and forks pray excuse me her father announced to the table i find i have small appetite tonight he walked from the hall after he was gone sansa exchanged excited whispers with jeyne poole down the table jory laughed at a joke and hullen started in about horseflesh your warhorse now he may not be the best one for the joust not the same thing oh no not the same at all the men had heard it all before desmond jacks and hullens son harwin shouted him down together and porther called for more wine no one talked to arya she didnt care she liked it that way she would have eaten her meals alone in her bedchamber if they let her sometimes they did when father had to dine with the king or some lord or the envoys from this place or that place the rest of the time they ate in his solar just him and her and sansa that was when arya missed her brothers most she wanted to tease bran and play with baby rickon and have robb smile at her she wanted jon to muss up her hair and call her little sister and finish her sentences with her but all of them were gone she had no one left but sansa and sansa wouldnt even talk to her unless father made her back at winterfell they had eaten in the great hall almost half the time her father used to say that a lord needed to eat with his men if he hoped to keep them know the men who follow you she heard him tell robb once and let them know you dont ask your men to die for a stranger at winterfell he always had an extra seat set at his own table and every day a different man would be asked to join him one night it would be vayon poole and the talk would be coppers and bread stores and servants the next time it would be mikken and her father would listen to him go on about armor and swords and how hot a forge should be and the best way to temper steel another day it might be hullen with his endless horse talk or septon chayle from the library or jory or ser rodrik or even old nan with her stories arya had loved nothing better than to sit at her fathers table and listen to them talk she had loved listening to the men on the benches too to freeriders tough as leather courtly knights and bold young squires grizzled old men at arms she used to throw snowballs at them and help them steal pies from the kitchen their wives gave her scones and she invented names for their babies and played monsters andmaidens and hide the treasure and come into my castle with their children fat tom used to call her arya underfoot because he said that was where she always was shed liked that a lot better than arya horseface only that was winterfell a world away and now everything was changed this was the first time they had supped with the men since arriving in kings landing arya hated it she hated the sounds of their voices now the way they laughed the stories they told theyd been her friends shed felt safe around them but now she knew that was a lie theyd let the queen kill lady that was horrible enough but then the hound found mycah jeyne poole had told arya that hed cut him up in so many pieces that theyd given him back to the butcher in a bag and at first the poor man had thought it was a pig theyd slaughtered and no one had raised a voice or drawn a blade or anything not harwin who always talked so bold or alyn who was going to be a knight or jory who was captain of the guard not even her father he was my ffiend arya whispered into her plate so low that no one could hear her ribs sat there untouched grown cold now a thin film of grease congealing beneath them on the plate arya looked at them and felt ill she pushed away from the table pray where do you think you are going young lady septa mordane asked im not hungry arya found it an effort to remember her courtesies may i be excused please she recited stiffly you may not the septa said you have scarcely touched your food you will sit down and clean your plate you clean it before anyone could stop her arya bolted for the door as the men laughed and septa mordane called loudly after her her voice rising higher and higher fat tom was at his post guarding the door to the tower of the hand he blinked when he saw arya rushing toward him and heard the septas shouts here now little one hold on he started to say reaching but arya slid between his legs and then she was running up the winding tower steps her feet hammering on the stone while fat tom huffed and puffed behind her her bedchamber was the only place that arya liked in all of kings landing and the thing she liked best about it was the door a massive slab of dark oak with black iron bands when she slammed that door and dropped the heavy crossbar nobody could get into her room not septa mordane or fat tom or sansa or jory or the hound nobody she slammed it now when the bar was down arya finally felt safe enough to cry she went to the window seat and sat there sniffling hating them all and herself most of all it was all her fault everything bad that had happened sansa said so and jeyne too fat tom was knocking on her door arya girl whats wrong he called out you in there no she shouted the knocking stopped a moment later she heard him going away fat tom was always easy to fool arya went to the chest at the foot of her bed she knelt opened the lid and began pulling her clothes out with both hands grabbing handfuls of silk and satin and velvet and wool and tossing them on the floor it was there at the bottom of the chest where shed hidden it arya lifted it out almost tenderly and drew the slender blade from its sheath needle she thought of mycah again and her eyes filled with tears her fault her fault her fault if she had never asked him to play at swords with her there was a pounding at her door louder than before arya stark you open this door at once do you hear me arya spun around with needle in her hand you better not come in here she warned she slashed at the air savagely the hand will hear of this septa mordane raged i dont care arya screamed go away you will rue this insolent behavior young lady i promise you that arya listened at the door until she heard the sound of the septas receding footsteps she went back to the window needle in hand and looked down into the courtyard below if only she could climb like bran she thought she would go out the window and down the tower run away from this horrible place away from sansa and septa mordane and prince joffrey from all of them steal some food from the kitchens take needle and her good boots and a warm cloak she could find nymeria in the wild woods below the trident and together theyd return to winterfell or run to jon on the wall she found herself wishing that jon was here with her now then maybe she wouldnt feel so alone a soft knock at the door behind her turned arya away from the window and her dreams of escape arya her fathers voice called out open the door we need to talk arya crossed the room and lifted the crossbar father was alone he seemed more sad than angry that made arya feel even worse may i come in arya nodded then dropped her eyes ashamed father closed the door whose sword is that mine arya had almost forgotten needle in her hand give it to me reluctantly arya surrendered her sword wondering if she would ever hold it again her father turned it in the light examining both sides of the blade he tested the point with his thumb a bravos blade he said yet it seems to me that i know this makers mark this is mikkens work arya could not lie to him she lowered her eyes lord eddard stark sighed my nine year old daughter is being armed from my own forge and i know nothing of it the hand of the king is expected to rule the seven kingdoms yet it seems i cannot even rule my own household how is it that you come to own a sword arya where did you get this arya chewed her lip and said nothing she would not betray jon not even to their father after a while father said i dont suppose it matters truly he looked down gravely at the sword in his hands this is no toy for children least of all for a girl what would septa mordane say if she knew you were playing with swords i wasnt playing arya insisted i hate septa mordane thats enough her fathers voice was curt and hard the septa is doing no more than is her duty though gods know you have made it a struggle for the poor woman your mother and i have charged her with the impossible task of making you a lady i dont want to be a lady arya flared i ought to snap this toy across my knee here and now and put an end to this nonsense needle wouldnt break arya said defiantly but her voice betrayed her words it has a name does it her father sighed ah arya you have a wildness in you child the wolf blood my father used to call it lyanna had a touch of it and my brother brandon more than a touch it brought them both to an early grave arya heard sadness in his voice he did not often speak of his father or of the brother and sister who had died before she was born lyanna might have carried a sword if my lord father had allowed it you remind me of her sometimes you even look like her lyanna was beautiful arya said startled everybody said so it was not a thing that was ever said of arya she was eddard stark agreed beautiful and willful and dead before her time he lifted the sword held it out between them arya what did you think to do with this needle who did you hope to skewer your sister septa mordane do you know the first thing about sword fighting all she could think of was the lesson jon had given her stick them with the pointy end she blurted out her father snorted back laughter that is the essence of it i suppose arya desperately wanted to explain to make him see i was trying to learn but her eyes filled with tears i asked mycah to practice with me the grief came on her all at once she turned away shaking i asked him she cried it was my fault it was me suddenly her fathers arms were around her he held her gently as she turned to him and sobbed against his chest no sweet one he murmured grieve for your friend but never blame yourself you did not kill the butchers boy that murder lies at the hounds door him and the cruel woman he serves i hate them arya confided red faced sniffling the hound and the queen and the king and prince joffrey i hate all of them joffrey lied it wasnt the way he said i hate sansa too she did remember she just lied so joffrey would like her we all lie her father said or did you truly think id believe that nymeria ran off arya blushed guiltily jory promised not to tell jory kept his word her father said with a smile there are some things i do not need to be told even a blind man could see that wolf would never have left you willingly we had to throw rocks she said miserably i told her to run to go be free that i didnt want her anymore there were other wolves for her to play with we heard them howling and jory said the woods were full of game so shed have deer to hunt only she kept following and finally we had to throw rocks i hit her twice she whined and looked at me and i felt so shamed but it was right wasnt it the queen would have killed her it was right her father said and even the lie was not without honor hed put needle aside when he went to arya to embrace her now he took the blade up again and walked to the window where he stood for a moment looking out across the courtyard when he turned back his eyes were thoughtful he seated himself on the window seat needle across his lap arya sit down i need to try and explain some things to you she perched anxiously on the edge of her bed you are too young to be burdened with all my cares he told her but you are also a stark of winterfell you know our words winter is coming arya whispered the hard cruel times her father said we tasted them on the trident child and when bran fell you were born in the long summer sweet one youve never known anything else but now the winter is truly coming remember the sigil of our house arya the direwolf she said thinking of nymeria she hugged her knees against her chest suddenly afraid let me tell you something about wolves child when the snows fall and the white winds blow the lone wolf dies but the pack survives summer is the time for squabbles in winter we must protect one another keep each other warm share our strengths so if you must hate arya hate those who would truly do us harm septa mordane is a good woman and sansa sansa is your sister you may be as different as the sun and the moon but the same blood flows through both your hearts you need her as she needs you and i need both of you gods help me he sounded so tired that it made arya sad i dont hate sansa she told him not truly it was only half a lie i do not mean to frighten you but neither will i lie to you we have come to a dark dangerous place child this is not winterfell we have enemies who mean us ill we cannot fight a war among ourselves this willfulness of yours the running off the angry words the disobedience at home these were only the summer games of a child here and now with winter soon upon us that is a different matter it is time to begin growing up i will arya vowed she had never loved him so much as she did in that instant i can be strong too i can be as strong as robb he held needle out to her hilt first here she looked at the sword with wonder in her eyes for a moment she was afraid to touch it afraid that if she reached for it it would be snatched away again but then her father said go on its yours and she took it in her hand i can keep it she said for true for true he smiled if i took it away no doubt id find a morningstar hidden under your pillow within the fortnight try not to stab your sister whatever the provocation i wont i promise arya clutched needle tightly to her chest as her father took his leave the next morning as they broke their fast she apologized to septa mordane and asked for her pardon the septa peered at her suspiciously but father nodded three days later at midday her fathers steward vayon poole sent arya to the small hall the trestle tables had been dismantled and the benches shoved against the walls the hall seemed empty until an unfamiliar voice said you are late boy a slight man with a bald head and a great beak of a nose stepped out of the shadows holding a pair of slender wooden swords tomorrow you will be here at midday he had an accent the lilt of the free cities braavos perhaps or myr who are you arya asked i am your dancing master he tossed her one of the wooden blades she grabbed for it missed and heard it clatter to the floor tomorrow you will catch it now pick it up it was not just a stick but a true wooden sword complete with grip and guard and pommel arya picked it up and clutched it nervously with both hands holding it out in front of her it was heavier than it looked much heavier than needle the bald man clicked his teeth together that is not the way boy this is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it you will take the blade in one hand its too heavy arya said it is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong and for the balancing a hollow inside is filled with lead just so one hand now is all that is needing arya took her right hand off the grip and wiped her sweaty palm on her pants she held the sword in her left hand he seemed to approve the left is good all is reversed it will make your enemies more awkward now you are standing wrong turn your body sideface yes so you are skinny as the shaft of a spear do you know that is good too the target is smaller now the grip let me see he moved closer and peered at her hand prying her fingers apart rearranging them just so yes do not squeeze it so tight no the grip must be deft delicate what if i drop it arya said the steel must be part of your arm the bald man told her can you drop part of your arm no nine years syrio forel was first sword to the sealord of braavos he knows these things listen to him boy it was the third time he had called her boy im a girl arya objected boy girl syrio forel said you are a sword that is all he clicked his teeth together just so that is the grip you are not holding a battle axe you are holding a needle arya finished for him fiercely just so now we will begin the dance remember child this is not the iron dance of westeros we are learning the knights dance hacking and hammering no this is the bravos dance the water dance swift and sudden all men are made of water do you know this when you pierce them the water leaks out and they die he took a step backward raised his own wooden blade now you will try to strike me arya tried to strike him she tried for four hours until every muscle in her body was sore and aching while syrio forel clicked his teeth together and told her what to do the next day their real work began daenerys the dothraki sea ser jorah mormont said as he reined to a halt beside her on the top of the ridge beneath them the plain stretched out immense and empty a vast flat expanse that reached to the distant horizon and beyond it was a sea dany thought past here there were no hills no mountains no trees nor cities nor roads only the endless grasses the tall blades rippling like waves when the winds blew its so green she said here and now ser jorah agreed you ought to see it when it blooms all dark red flowers from horizon to horizon like a sea of blood come the dry season and the world turns the color of old bronze and this is only hranna child there are a hundred kinds of grass out there grasses as yellow as lemon and as dark as indigo blue grasses and orange grasses and grasses like rainbows down in the shadow lands beyond asshai they say there are oceans of ghost grass taller than a man on horseback with stalks as pale as milkglass it murders all other grass and glows in the dark with the spirits of the damned the dothraki claim that someday ghost grass will cover the entire world and then all life will end that thought gave dany the shivers i dont want to talk about that now she said its so beautiful here i dont want to think about everything dying as you will khaleesi ser jorah said respectfully she heard the sound of voices and turned to look behind her she and mormont had outdistanced the rest of their party and now the others were climbing the ridge below them her handmaid irri and the young archers of her khas were fluid as centaurs but viserys still struggled with the short stirrups and the flat saddle her brother was miserable out here he ought never have come magister illyrio had urged him to wait in pentos had offered him the hospitality of his manse but viserys would have none of it he would stay with drogo until the debt had been paid until he had the crown he had been promised and if he tries to cheat me he will learn to his sorrow what it means to wake the dragon viserys had vowed laying a hand on his borrowed sword illyrio had blinked at that and wished him good fortune dany realized that she did not want to listen to any of her brothers complaints right now the day was too perfect the sky was a deep blue and high above them a hunting hawk circled the grass sea swayed and sighed with each breath of wind the air was warm on her face and dany felt at peace she would not let viserys spoil it wait here dany told ser jorah tell them all to stay tell them i command it the knight smiled ser jorah was not a handsome man he had a neck and shoulders like a bull and coarse black hair covered his arms and chest so thickly that there was none left for his head yet his smiles gave dany comfort you are learning to talk like a queen daenerys not a queen said dany a khaleesi she wheeled her horse about and galloped down the ridge alone the descent was steep and rocky but dany rode fearlessly and the joy and the danger of it were a song in her heart all her life viserys had told her she was a princess but not until she rode her silver had daenerys targaryen ever felt like one at first it had not come easy the khalasar had broken camp the morning after her wedding moving east toward vaes dothrak and by the third day dany thought she was going to die saddle sores opened on her bottom hideous and bloody her thighs were chafed raw her hands blistered from the reins the muscles of her legs and back so wracked with pain that she could scarcely sit by the time dusk fell her handmaids would need to help her down from her mount even the nights brought no relief khal drogo ignored her when they rode even as he had ignored her during their wedding and spent his evenings drinking with his warriors and bloodriders racing his prize horses watching women dance and men die dany had no place in these parts of his life she was left to sup alone or with ser jorah and her brother and afterward to cry herself to sleep yet every night some time before the dawn drogo would come to her tent and wake her in the dark to ride her as relentlessly as he rode his stallion he always took her from behind dothraki fashion for which dany was grateful that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet her face and she could use her pillow to muffle her cries of pain when he was done he would close his eyes and begin to snore softly and dany would lie beside him her body bruised and sore hurting too much for sleep day followed day and night followed night until dany knew she could not endure a moment longer she would kill herself rather than go on she decided one night yet when she slept that night she dreamt the dragon dream again viserys was not in it this time there was only her and the dragon its scales were black as night wet and slick with blood her blood dany sensed its eyes were pools of molten magma and when it opened its mouth the flame came roaring out in a hot jet she could hear it singing to her she opened her arms to the fire embraced it let it swallow her whole let it cleanse her and temper her and scour her clean she could feel her flesh sear and blacken and slough away could feel her blood boil and turn to steam and yet there was no pain she felt strong and new and fierce and the next day strangely she did not seem to hurt quite so much it was as if the gods had heard her and taken pity even her handmaids noticed the change khaleesi jhiqui said what is wrong are you sick i was she answered standing over the dragons eggs that illyrio had given her when she wed she touched one the largest of the three running her hand lightly over the shelf black and scarlet she thought like the dragon in my dream the stone felt strangely warm beneath her fingers or was she still dreaming she pulled her hand back nervously from that hour onward each day was easier than the one before it her legs grew stronger her blisters burst and her hands grew callused her soft thighs toughened supple as leather the khal had commanded the handmaid irri to teach dany to ride in the dothraki fashion but it was the filly who was her real teacher the horse seemed to know her moods as if they shared a single mind with every passing day dany felt surer in her seat the dothraki were a hard and unsentimental people and it was not their custom to name their animals so dany thought of her only as the silver she had never loved anything so much as the riding became less an ordeal dany began to notice the beauties of the land around her she rode at the head of the khalasar with drogo and his bloodriders so she came to each country fresh and unspoiled behind them the great horde might tear the earth and muddy the rivers and send up clouds of choking dust but the fields ahead of them were always green and verdant they crossed the rolling hills of norvos past terraced farms and small villages where the townsfolk watched anxiously from atop white stucco walls they forded three wide placid rivers and a fourth that was swift and narrow and treacherous camped beside a high blue waterfall skirted the tumbled ruins of a vast dead city where ghosts were said to moan among blackened marble columns they raced down valyrian roads a thousand years old and straight as a dothraki arrow for half a moon they rode through the forest of qohor where the leaves made a golden canopy high above them and the trunks of the trees were as wide as city gates there were great elk in that wood and spotted tigers and lemurs with silver fur and huge purple eyes but all fled before the approach of the khalasar and dany got no glimpse of them by then her agony was a fading memory she still ached after a long days riding yet somehow the pain had a sweetness to it now and each morning she came willingly to her saddle eager to know what wonders waited for her in the lands ahead she began to find pleasure even in her nights and if she still cried out when drogo took her it was not always in pain at the bottom of the ridge the grasses rose around her tall and supple dany slowed to a trot and rode out onto the plain losing herself in the green blessedly alone in the khalasar she was never alone khal drogo came to her only after the sun went down but her handmaids fed her and bathed her and slept by the door of her tent drogos bloodriders and the men of her khas were never far and her brother was an unwelcome shadow day and night dany could hear him on the top of the ridge his voice shrill with anger as he shouted at ser jorah she rode on submerging herself deeper in the dothraki sea the green swallowed her up the air was rich with the scents of earth and grass mixed with the smell of horseflesh and danys sweat and the oil in her hair dothraki smells they seemed to belong here dany breathed it all in laughing she had a sudden urge to feel the ground beneath her to curl her toes in that thick black soil swinging down from her saddle she let the silver graze while she pulled off her high boots viserys came upon her as sudden as a summer storm his horse rearing beneath him as he reined up too hard you dare he screamed at her you give commands to me to me he vaulted off the horse stumbling as he landed his face was flushed as he struggled back to his feet he grabbed her shook her have you forgotten who you are look at you look at you dany did not need to look she was barefoot with oiled hair wearing dothraki riding leathers and a painted vest given her as a bride gift she looked as though she belonged here viserys was soiled and stained in city silks and ringmail he was still screaming you do not command the dragon do you understand i am the lord of the seven kingdoms i will not hear orders from some horselords slut do you hear me his hand went under her vest his fingers digging painfully into her breast do you hear me dany shoved him away hard viserys stared at her his lilac eyes incredulous she had never defied him never fought back rage twisted his features he would hurt her now and badly she knew that crack the whip made a sound like thunder the coil took viserys around the throat and yanked him backward he went sprawling in the grass stunned and choking the dothraki riders hooted at him as he struggled to free himself the one with the whip young jhogo rasped a question dany did not understand his words but by then irri was there and ser jorah and the rest of her khas jhogo asks if you would have him dead khaleesi irri said no dany replied no jhogo understood that one of the others barked out a comment and the dothraki laughed irri told her quaro thinks you should take an ear to teach him respect her brother was on his knees his fingers digging under the leather coils crying incoherently struggling for breath the whip was tight around his windpipe tell them i do not wish him harmed dany said irri repeated her words in dothraki jhogo gave a pull on the whip yanking viserys around like a puppet on a string he went sprawling again freed from the leather embrace a thin line of blood under his chin where the whip had cut deep i warned him what would happen my lady ser jorah mormont said i told him to stay on the ridge as you commanded i know you did dany replied watching viserys he lay on the ground sucking in air noisily red faced and sobbing he was a pitiful thing he had always been a pitiful thing why had she never seen that before there was a hollow place inside her where her fear had been take his horse dany commanded ser jorah viserys gaped at her he could not believe what he was hearing nor could dany quite believe what she was saying yet the words came let my brother walk behind us back to the khalasar among the dothraki the man who does not ride was no man at all the lowest of the low without honor or pride let everyone see him as he is no viserys screamed he turned to ser jorah pleading in the common tongue with words the horsemen would not understand hit her mormont hurt her your king commands it kill these dothraki dogs and teach her the exile knight looked from dany to her brother she barefoot with dirt between her toes and oil in her hair he with his silks and steel dany could see the decision on his face he shall walk khaleesi he said he took her brothers horse in hand while dany remounted her silver viserys gaped at him and sat down in the dirt he kept his silence but he would not move and his eyes were full of poison as they rode away soon he was lost in the tall grass when they could not see him anymore dany grew afraid will he find his way back she asked ser jorah as they rode even a man as blind as your brother should be able to follow our trail he replied he is proud he may be too shamed to come back jorah laughed where else should he go if he cannot find the khalasar the khalasar will most surely find him it is hard to drown in the dothraki sea child dany saw the truth of that the khalasar was like a city on the march but it did not march blindly always scouts ranged far ahead of the main column alert for any sign of game or prey or enemies while outriders guarded their flanks they missed nothing not here in this land the place where they had come from these plains were a part of them and of her now i hit him she said wonder in her voice now that it was over it seemed like some strange dream that she had dreamed ser jorah do you think hell be so angry when he gets back she shivered i woke the dragon didnt it ser jorah snorted can you wake the dead girl your brother rhaegar was the last dragon and he died on the trident viserys is less than the shadow of a snake his blunt words startled her it seemed as though all the things she had always believed were suddenly called into question you you swore him your sword that i did girl ser jorah said and if your brother is the shadow of a snake what does that make his servants his voice was bitter he is still the true king he is jorah pulled up his horse and looked at her truth now would you want to see viserys sit a throne dany thought about that he would not be a very good king would he there have been worse but not many the knight gave his heels to his mount and started off again dany rode close beside him still she said the common people are waiting for him magister illyrio says they are sewing dragon banners and praying for viserys to return from across the narrow sea to free them the common people pray for rain healthy children and a summer that never ends ser jorah told her it is no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones so long as they are left in peace he gave a shrug they never are dany rode along quietly for a time working his words like a puzzle box it went against everything that viserys had ever told her to think that the people could care so little whether a true king or a usurper reigned over them yet the more she thought on jorahs words the more they rang of truth what do you pray for ser jorah she asked him home he said his voice was thick with longing i pray for home too she told him believing it ser jorah laughed look around you then khaleesi but it was not the plains dany saw then it was kings landing and the great red keep that aegon the conqueror had built it was dragonstone where she had been born in her minds eye they burned with a thousand lights a fire blazing in every window in her minds eye all the doors were red my brother will never take back the seven kingdoms dany said she had known that for a long time she realized she had known it all her life only she had never let herself say the words even in a whisper but now she said them for jorah mormont and all the world to hear a gaml of thronls ser jorah gave her a measuring look you think not he could not lead an army even if my lord husband gave him one dany said he has no coin and the only knight who follows him reviles him as less than a snake the dothraki make mock of his weakness he will never take us home wise child the knight smiled i am no child she told him fiercely her heels pressed into the sides of her mount rousing the silver to a gallop faster and faster she raced leaving jorah and irri and the others far behind the warm wind in her hair and the setting sun red on her face by the time she reached the khalasar it was dusk the slaves had erected her tent by the shore of a spring fed pool she could hear rough voices from the woven grass palace on the hill soon there would be laughter when the men of her khas told the story of what had happened in the grasses today by the time viserys came limping back among them every man woman and child in the camp would know him for a walker there were no secrets in the khalasar dany gave the silver over to the slaves for grooming and entered her tent it was cool and dim beneath the silk as she let the door flap close behind her dany saw a finger of dusty red light reach out to touch her dragons eggs across the tent for an instant a thousand droplets of scarlet flame swam before her eyes she blinked and they were gone stone she told herself they are only stone even illyrio said so the dragons are all dead she put her palm against the black egg fingers spread gently across the curve of the shell the stone was warm almost hot the sun dany whispered the sun warmed them as they rode she commanded her handmaids to prepare her a bath doreah built a fire outside the tent while irri and jhiqui fetched the big copper tub another bride gift from the packhorses and carried water from the pool when the bath was steaming irri helped her into it and climbed in after her have you ever seen a dragon she asked as irri scrubbed her back and jhiqui sluiced sand from her hair she had heard that the first dragons had come from the east from the shadow lands beyond asshai and the islands of the jade sea perhaps some were still living there in realms strange and wild dragons are gone khaleesi irri said dead agreed jhiqui long and long ago viserys had told her that the last targaryen dragons had died no more than a century and a half ago during the reign of aegon who was called the dragonbane that did not seem so long ago to dany everywhere she said disappointed even in the east magic had died in the west when the doom fell on valyria and the lands of the long summer and neither spell forged steel nor stormsingers nor dragons could hold it back but dany had always heard that the east was different it was said that manticores prowled the islands of the jade sea that basilisks infested the jungles of yi ti that spellsingers warlocks and aeromancers practiced their arts openly in asshai while shadowbinders and bloodmages worked terrible sorceries in the black of night why shouldnt there be dragons too no dragon irri said brave men kill them for dragon terrible evil beasts it is known it is known agreed jhiqui a trader from qarth once told me that dragons came from the moon blond doreah said as she warmed a towel over the fire jhiqui and irri were of an age with dany dothraki girls taken as slaves when drogo destroyed their fathers khalasar doreah was older almost twenty magister illyrio had found her in a pleasure house in lys silvery wet hair tumbled across her eyes as dany turned her head curious the moon he told me the moon was an egg khaleesi the lysene girl said once there were two moons in the sky but one wandered too close to the sun and cracked from the heat a thousand thousand dragons poured forth and drank the fire of the sun that is why dragons breathe flame one day the other moon will kiss the sun too and then it will crack and the dragons will return the two dothraki girls giggled and laughed you are foolish strawhead slave irri said moon is no egg moon is god woman wife of sun it is known it is known jhiqui agreed danys skin was flushed and pink when she climbed from the tub jhiqui laid her down to oil her body and scrape the dirt from her pores afterward irri sprinkled her with spiceflower and cinnamon while doreah brushed her hair until it shone like spun silver she thought about the moon and eggs and dragons her supper was a simple meal of fruit and cheese and fry bread with a jug of honeyed wine to wash it down doreah stay and eat with me dany commanded when she sent her other handmaids away the lysene girl had hair the color of honey and eyes like the summer sky she lowered those eyes when they were alone you honor me khaleesi she said but it was no honor only service long after the moon had risen they sat together talking that night when khal drogo came dany was waiting for him he stood in the door of her tent and looked at her with surprise she rose slowly and opened her sleeping silks and let them fall to the ground this night we must go outside my lord she told him for the dothraki believed that all things of importance in a mans life must be done beneath the open sky khal drogo followed her out into the moonlight the bells in his hair tinkling softly a few yards from her tent was a bed of soft grass and it was there that dany drew him down when he tried to turn her over she put a hand on his chest no she said this night i would look on your face there is no privacy in the heart of the khalasar dany felt the eyes on her as she undressed him heard the soft voices as she did the things that doreah had told her to do it was nothing to her was she not khaleesi his were the only eyes that mattered and when she mounted him she saw something there that she had never seen before she rode him as fiercely as ever she had ridden her silver and when the moment of his pleasure came khal drogo called out her name they were on the far side of the dothraki sea when jhiqui brushed the soft swell of danys stomach with her fingers and said khaleesi you are with child i know dany told her it was her fourteenth name day bran in the yard below rickon ran with the wolves bran watched from his window seat wherever the boy went grey wind was there first loping ahead to cut him off until rickon saw him screamed in delight and went pelting off in another direction shaggydog ran at his heels spinning and snapping if the other wolves came too close his fur had darkened until he was all black and his eyes were green fire brans summer came last he was silver and smoke with eyes of yellow gold that saw all there was to see smaller than grey wind and more wary bran thought he was the smartest of the litter he could hear his brothers breathless laughter as rickon dashed across the hardpacked earth on little baby legs his eyes stung he wanted to be down there laughing and running angry at the thought bran knuckled away the tears before they could fall his eighth name day had come and gone he was almost a man grown now too old to cry it was just a lie he said bitterly remembering the crow from his dream i cant fly i cant even run crows are all liars old nan agreed from the chair where she sat doing her needlework i know a story about a crow i dont want any more stories bran snapped his voice petulant he had liked old nan and her stories once before but it was different now they left her with him all day now to watch over him and clean him and keep him from being lonely but she just made it worse i hate your stupid stories the old woman smiled at him toothlessly my stories no my little lord not mine the stories are before me and after me before you too she was a very ugly old woman bran thought spitefully shrunken and wrinkled almost blind too weak to climb stairs with only a few wisps of white hair left to cover a mottled pink scalp no one really knew how old she was but his father said shed been called old nan even when he was a boy she was the oldest person in winterfell for certain maybe the oldest person in the seven kingdoms nan had come to the castle as a wet nurse for a brandon stark whose mother had died birthing him he had been an older brother of lord rickard brans grandfather or perhaps a younger brother or a brother to lord rickards father sometimes old nan told it one way and sometimes another in all the stories the little boy died at three of a summer chill but old nan stayed on at winterfell with her own children she had lost both her sons to the war when king robert won the throne and her grandson was killed on the walls of pyke during balon greyjoys rebellion her daughters had long ago married and moved away and died all that was left of her own blood was hodor the simpleminded giant who worked in the stables but old nan just lived on and on doing her needlework and telling her stories i dont care whose stories they are bran told her i hate them he didnt want stories and he didnt want old nan he wanted his mother and father he wanted to go running with summer loping beside him he wanted to climb the broken tower and feed corn to the crows he wanted to ride his pony again with his brothers he wanted it to be the way it had been before i know a story about a boy who hated stories old nan said with her stupid little smile her needles moving all the while click click click until bran was ready to scream at her it would never be the way it had been he knew the crow had tricked him into flying but when he woke up he was broken and the world was changed they had all left him his father and his mother and his sisters and even his bastard brother jon his father had promised he would ride a real horse to kings landing but theyd gone without him maester luwin had sent a bird after lord eddard with a message and another to mother and a third to jon on the wall but there had been no answers ofttimes the birds are lost child the maester had told him theres many a mile and many a hawk between here and kings landing the message may not have reached them yet to bran it felt as if they had all died while he had slept or perhaps bran had died and they had forgotten him jory and ser rodrik and vayon poole had gone too and hullen and harwin and fat tom and a quarter of the guard only robb and baby rickon were still here and robb was changed he was robb the lord now or trying to be he wore a real sword and never smiled his days were spent drilling the guard and practicing his swordplay making the yard ring with the sound of steel as bran watched forlornly from his window at night he closeted himself with maester luwin talking or going over account books sometimes he would ride out with hallis mollen and be gone for days at a time visiting distant holdfasts whenever he was away more than a day rickon would cry and ask bran if robb was ever coming back even when he was home at winterfell robb the lord seemed to have more time for hallis mollen and theon greyjoy than he ever did for his brothers i could tell you the story about brandon the builder old nan said that was always your favorite thousands and thousands of years ago brandon the builder had raised winterfell and some said the wall bran knew the story but it had never been his favorite maybe one of the other brandons had liked that story sometimes nan would talk to him as if he were her brandon the baby she had nursed all those years ago and sometimes she confused him with his uncle brandon who was killed by the mad king before bran was even born she had lived so long mother had told him once that all the brandon starks had become one person in her head thats not my favorite he said my favorites were the scary ones he heard some sort of commotion outside and turned back to the window rickon was running across the yard toward the gatehouse the wolves following him but the tower faced the wrong way for bran to see what was happening he smashed a fist on his thigh in frustration and felt nothing oh my sweet summer child old nan said quietly what do you know of fear fear is for the winter my little lord when the snows fall a hundred feet deep and the ice wind comes howling out of the north fear is for the long night when the sun hides its face for years at a time and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry and the white walkers move through the woods you mean the others bran said querulously the others old nan agreed thousands and thousands of years a gaml of thronls ago a winter fell that was cold and hard and endless beyond all memory of man there came a night that lasted a generation and kings shivered and died in their castles even as the swineherds in their hovels women smothered their children rather than see them starve and cried and felt their tears freeze on their cheeks her voice and her needles fell silent and she glanced up at bran with pale filmy eyes and asked so child this is the sort of story you like well bran said reluctantly yes only old nan nodded in that darkness the others came for the first time she said as her needles went click click click they were cold things dead things that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun and every creature with hot blood in its veins they swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms felled heroes and armies by the score riding their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain all the swords of men could not stay their advance and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in them they hunted the maids through frozen forests and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children her voice had dropped very low almost to a whisper and bran found himself leaning forward to listen now these were the days before the andals came and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of the rhoyne and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the first men who had taken these lands from the children of the forest yet here and there in the fastness of the woods the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills and the faces in the trees kept watch so as cold and death filled the earth the last hero determined to seek out the children in the hopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost he set out into the dead lands with a sword a horse a dog and a dozen companions for years he searched until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities one by one his friends died and his horse and finally even his dog and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it and the others smelled the hot blood in him and came silent on his trail stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds the door opened with a bang and brans heart leapt up into his mouth in sudden fear but it was only maester luwin with hodor looming in the stairway behind him hodor the stableboy announced as was his custom smiling hugely at them all maester luwin was not smiling we have visitors he announced and your presence is required bran im listening to a story now bran complained stories wait my little lord and when you come back to them why there they are old nan said visitors are not so patient and ofttimes they bring stories of their own who is it bran asked maester luwin tyrion lannister and some men of the nights watch with word from your brother jon robb is meeting with them now hodor will you help bran down to the hall hodor hodor agreed happily he ducked to get his great shaggy head under the door hodor was nearly seven feet tall it was hard to believe that he was the same blood as old nan bran wondered if he would shrivel up as small as his great grandmother when he was old it did not seem likely even if hodor lived to be a thousand hodor lifted bran as easy as if he were a bale of hay and cradled him against his massive chest he always smelled faintly of horses but it was not a bad smell his arms were thick with muscle and matted with brown hair hodor he said again theon greyjoy had once commented that hodor did not know much but no one could doubt that he knew his name old nan had cackled like a hen when bran told her that and confessed that hodors real name was walder no one knew where hodor had come from she said but when he started saying it they started calling him by it it was the only word he had they left old nan in the tower room with her needles and her memories hodor hummed tunelessly as he carried bran down the steps and through the gallery with maester luwin following behind hurrying to keep up with the stableboys long strides robb was seated in fathers high seat wearing ringmail and boiled leather and the stern face of robb the lord theon greyjoy and hallis mollen stood behind him a dozen guardsmen lined the grey stone walls beneath tall narrow windows in the center of the room the dwarf stood with his servants and four strangers in the black of the nights watch bran could sense the anger in the hall the moment that hodor carried him through the doors any man of the nights watch is welcome here at winterfell for as long as he wishes to stay robb was saying with the voice of robb the lord his sword was across his knees the steel bare for all the world to see even bran knew what it meant to greet a guest with an unsheathed sword any man of the nights watch the dwarf repeated but not me do i take your meaning boy robb stood and pointed at the little man with his sword i am the lord here while my mother and father are away lannister i am not your boy if you are a lord you might learn a lords courtesy the little man replied ignoring the sword point in his face your bastard brother has all your fathers graces it would seem jon bran gasped out from hodors arms the dwarf turned to look at him so it is true the boy lives i could scarce believe it you starks are hard to kill you lannisters had best remember that robb said lowering his sword hodor bring my brother here hodor hodor said and he trotted forward smiling and set bran in the high seat of the starks where the lords of winterfell had sat since the days when they called themselves the kings in the north the seat was cold stone polished smooth by countless bottoms the carved heads of direwolves snarled on the ends of its massive arms bran clasped them as he sat his useless legs dangling the great seat made him feel half a baby robb put a hand on his shoulder you said you had business with bran well here he is lannister bran was uncomfortably aware of tyrion lannisters eyes one was black and one was green and both were looking at him studying him weighing him i am told you were quite the climber bran the little man said at last tell me how is it you happened to fall that day i never bran insisted he never fell never never never the child does not remember anything of the fall or the climb that came before it said maester luwin gently curious said tyrion lannister my brother is not here to answer questions lannister robb said curtly do your business and be on your way i have a gift for you the dwarf said to bran do you like to ride boy maester luwin came forward my lord the child has lost the use of his legs he cannot sit a horse nonsense said lannister with the right horse and the right saddle even a cripple can ride the word was a knife through brans heart he felt tears come unbidden to his eyes im not a cripple then i am not a dwarf the dwarf said with a twist of his mouth my father will rejoice to hear it greyjoy laughed what sort of horse and saddle are you suggesting maester luwin asked a smart horse lannister replied the boy cannot use his legs to command the animal so you must shape the horse to the rider teach it to respond to the reins to the voice i would begin with an unbroken yearling with no old training to be unlearned he drew a rolled paper from his belt give this to your saddler he will provide the rest maester luwin took the paper from the dwarfs hand curious as a small grey squirrel he unrolled it studied it i see you draw nicely my lord yes this ought to work i should have thought of this myself it came easier to me maester it is not terribly unlike my own saddles will i truly be able to ride bran asked he wanted to believe them but he was afraid perhaps it was just another lie the crow had promised him that he could fly you will the dwarf told him and i swear to you boy on horseback you will be as tall as any of them robb stark seemed puzzled is this some trap lannister whats bran to you why should you want to help him your brother jon asked it of me and i have a tender spot in my heart for cripples and bastards and broken things tyrion lannister placed a hand over his heart and grinned the door to the yard flew open sunlight came streaming across the hall as rickon burst in breathless the direwolves were with him the boy stopped by the door wide eyed but the wolves came on their eyes found lannister or perhaps they caught his scent summer began to growl first grey wind picked it up they padded toward the little man one from the right and one from the left the wolves do not like your smell lannister theon greyioy commented perhaps its time i took my leave tyrion said he took a step backward and shaggydog came out of the shadows behind him snarling lannister recoiled and summer lunged at him from the other side he reeled away unsteady on his feet and grey wind snapped at his arm teeth ripping at his sleeve and tearing loose a scrap of cloth no bran shouted from the high seat as lannisters men reached for their steel summer here summer to me the direwolf heard the voice glanced at bran and again at lannister he crept backward away from the little man and settled down below brans dangling feet robb had been holding his breath he let it out with a sigh and called grey wind his direwolf moved to him swift and silent now there was only shaggydog rumbling at the small man his eyes burning like green fire rickon call him bran shouted to his baby brother and rickon remembered himself and screamed home shaggy home now the black wolf gave lannister one final snarl and bounded off to rickon who hugged him tightly around the neck tyrion lannister undid his scarf mopped at his brow and said in a flat voice how interesting are you well my lord asked one of his men his sword in hand he glanced nervously at the direwolves as he spoke my sleeve is torn and my breeches are unaccountably damp but nothing was harmed save my dignity even robb looked shaken the wolves i dont know why they did that no doubt they mistook me for dinner lannister bowed stiffly to bran i thank you for calling them off young ser i promise you they would have found me quite indigestible and now i will be leaving truly a moment my lord maester luwin said he moved to robb and they huddled close together whispering bran tried to hear what they were saying but their voices were too low robb stark finally sheathed his sword i i may have been hasty with you he said youve done bran a kindness and well robb composed himself with an effort the hospitality of winterfell is yours if you wish it lannister spare me your false courtesies boy you do not love me and you do not want me here i saw an inn outside your walls in the winter town ill find a bed there and both of us will sleep easier for a few coppers i may even find a comely wench to warm the sheets for me he spoke to one of the black brothers an old man with a twisted back and a tangled beard yoren we go south at daybreak you will find me on the road no doubt with that he made his exit struggling across the hall on his short legs past rickon and out the door his men followed the four of the nights watch remained robb turned to them uncertainly i have had rooms prepared and youll find no lack of hot water to wash off the dust of the road i hope you will honor us at table tonight he spoke the words so awkwardly that even bran took note it was a speech he had learned not words from the heart but the black brothers thanked him all the same summer followed them up the tower steps as hodor carried bran back to his bed old nan was asleep in her chair hodor said hodor gathered up his great grandmother and carried her off snoring softly while bran lay thinking robb had promised that he could feast with the nights watch in the great hall summer he called the wolf bounded up on the bed bran hugged him so hard he could feel the hot breath on his cheek i can ride now he whispered to his friend we can go hunting in the woods soon wait and see after a time he slept in his dream he was climbing again pulling himself up an ancient windowless tower his fingers forcing themselves between blackened stones his feet scrabbling for purchase higher and higher he climbed through the clouds and into the night sky and still the tower rose before him when he paused to look down his head swam dizzily and he felt his fingers slipping bran cried out and clung for dear life the earth was a thousand miles beneath him and he could not fly he could not fly he waited until his heart had stopped pounding until he could breathe and he began to climb again there was no way to go but up far above him outlined against a vast pale moon he thought he could see the shapes of gargoyles his arms were sore and aching but he dared not rest he forced himself to climb faster the gargoyles watched him ascend their eyes glowed red as hot coals in a brazier perhaps once they had been lions but now they were twisted and grotesque bran could hear them whispering to each other in soft stone voices terrible to hear he must not listen he told himself he must not hear so long as he did not hear them he was safe but when the gargoyles pulled themselves loose from the stone and padded down the side of the tower to where bran clung he knew he was not safe after all i didnt hear he wept as they came closer and closer i didnt i didnt he woke gasping lost in darkness and saw a vast shadow looming over him i didnt hear he whispered trembling in fear but then the shadow said hodor and lit the candle by the bedside and bran sighed with relief hodor washed the sweat from him with a warm damp cloth and dressed him with deft and gentle hands when it was time he carried him down to the great hall where a long trestle table had been set up near the fire the lords seat at the head of the table had been left empty but robb sat to the right of it with bran across from him they ate suckling pig that night and pigeon pie and turnips soaking in butter and afterward the cook had promised honeycombs summer snatched table scraps from brans hand while grey wind and shaggydog fought over a bone in the corner winterfells dogs would not come near the hall now bran had found that strange at first but he was growing used to it yoren was senior among the black brothers so the steward had seated him between robb and maester luwin the old man had a sour smell as if he had not washed in a long time he ripped at the meat with his teeth cracked the ribs to suck out the marrow from the bones and shrugged at the mention of jon snow ser allisers bane he grunted and two of his companions shared a laugh that bran did not understand but when robb asked for news of their uncle benjen the black brothers grew ominously quiet what is it bran asked yoren wiped his fingers on his vest theres hard news mlords and a cruel way to pay you for your meat and mead but the man as asks the question must bear the answer starks gone one of the other men said the old bear sent him out to look for waymar royce and hes late returning my lord too long yoren said most like hes dead my uncle is not dead robb stark said loudly anger in his tones he rose from the bench and laid his hand on the hilt of his sword do you hear me my uncle is not dead his voice rang against the stone walls and bran was suddenly afraid old sour smelling yoren looked up at robb unimpressed whatever you say mlord he said he sucked at a piece of meat between his teeth the youngest of the black brothers shifted uncomfortably in his seat theres not a man on the wall knows the haunted forest better than benjen stark hell find his way back well said yoren maybe he will and maybe he wont good men have gone into those woods before and never come out all bran could think of was old nans story of the others and the last hero hounded through the white woods by dead men and spiders big as hounds he was afraid for a moment until he remembered how that story ended the children will help him he blurted the children of the forest theon greyjoy sniggered and maester luwin said bran the children of the forest have been dead and gone for thousands of years all that is left of them are the faces in the trees down here might be thats true maester yoren said but up past the wall whos to say up there a man cant always tell whats alive and whats dead that night after the plates had been cleared robb carried bran up to bed himself grey wind led the way and summer came close behind his brother was strong for his age and bran was as light as a bundle of rags but the stairs were steep and dark and robb was breathing hard by the time they reached the top he put bran into bed covered him with blankets and blew out the candle for a time robb sat beside him in the dark bran wanted to talk to him but he did not know what to say well find a horse for you i promise robb whispered at last are they ever coming back bran asked him yes robb said with such hope in his voice that bran knew he was hearing his brother and not just robb the lord mother will be home soon maybe we can ride out to meet her when she comes wouldnt that surprise her to see you ahorse even in the dark room bran could feel his brothers smile and afterward well ride north to see the wall we wont even tell jon were coming well just be there one day you and me it will be an adventure an adventure bran repeated wistfully he heard his brother sob the room was so dark he could not see the tears on robbs face so he reached out and found his hand their fingers twined together eddard lord arryns death was a great sadness for all of us my lord grand maester pycelle said i would be more than happy to tell you what i can of the manner of his passing do be seated would you care for refreshments some dates perhaps i have some very fine persimmons as well wine no longer agrees with my digestion i fear but i can offer you a cup of iced milk sweetened with honey i find it most refreshing in this heat there was no denying the heat ned could feel the silk tunic clinging to his chest thick moist air covered the city like a damp woolen blanket and the riverside had grown unruly as the poor fled their hot airless warrens to jostle for sleeping places near the water where the only breath of wind was to be found that would be most kind ned said seating himself pycelle lifted a tiny silver bell with thumb and forefinger and tinkled it gently a slender young serving girl hurried into the solar iced milk for the kings hand and myself if you would be so kind child well sweetened as the girl went to fetch their drinks the grand maester knotted his fingers together and rested his hands on his stomach the smallfolk say that the last year of summer is always the hottest it is not so yet ofttimes it feels that way does it not on days like this i envy you northerners your summer snows the heavy jeweled chain around the old mans neck chinked softly as he shifted in his seat to be sure king maekars summer was hotter than this one and near as long there were fools even in the citadel who took that to mean that the great summer had come at last the summer that never ends but in the seventh year it broke suddenly and we had a short autumn and a terrible long winter still the heat was fierce while it lasted oldtown steamed and sweltered by day and came alive only by night we would walk in the gardens by the river and argue about the gods i remember the smells of those nights my lord perfume and sweat melons ripe to bursting peaches and pomegranates nightshade and moonbloom i was a young man then still forging my chain the heat did not exhaust me as it does now pycelles eyes were so heavily lidded he looked half asleep my pardons lord eddard you did not come to hear foolish meanderings of a summer forgotten before your father was born forgive an old man his wanderings if you would minds are like swords i do fear the old ones go to rust ah and here is our milk the serving girl placed the tray between them and pycelle gave her a smile sweet child he lifted a cup tasted nodded thank you you may go when the girl had taken her leave pycelle peered at ned through pale rheumy eyes now where were we oh yes you asked about lord arryn i did ned sipped politely at the iced milk it was pleasantly cold but oversweet to his taste if truth be told the hand had not seemed quite himself for some time pycelle said we had sat together on council many a year he and and the signs were there to read but i put them down to the great burdens he had borne so faithfully for so long those broad shoulders were weighed down by all the cares of the realm and more besides his son was ever sickly and his lady wife so anxious that she would scarcely let the boy out of her sight it was enough to weary even a strong man and the lord jon was not young small wonder if he seemed melancholy and tired or so i thought at the time yet now i am less certain he gave a ponderous shake of his head what can you tell me of his final illness the grand maester spread his hands in a gesture of helpless sorrow he came to me one day asking after a certain book as hale and healthy as ever though it did seem to me that something was troubling him deeply the next morning he was twisted over in pain too sick to rise from bed maester colemon thought it was a chill on the stomach the weather had been hot and the hand often iced his wine which can upset the digestion when lord jon continued to weaken i went to him myself but the gods did not grant me the power to save him i have heard that you sent maester colemon away the grand maesters nod was as slow and deliberate as a glacier i did and i fear the lady lysa will never forgive me that maybe i was wrong but at the time i thought it best maester colemon is like a son to me and i yield to none in my esteem for his abilities but he is young and the young ofttimes do not comprehend the frailty of an older body he was purging lord arryn with wasting potions and pepper juice and i feared he might kill him did lord arryn say anything to you during his final hours pycelle wrinkled his brow in the last stage of his fever the hand called out the name robert several times but whether he was asking for his son or for the king i could not say lady lysa would not permit the boy to enter the sickroom for fear that he too might be taken ill the king did come and he sat beside the bed for hours talking and joking of times long past in hopes of raising lord jons spirits his love was fierce to see was there nothing else no final words when i saw that all hope had fled i gave the hand the milk of the poppy so he should not suffer just before he closed his eyes for the last time he whispered something to the king and his lady wife a blessing for his son the seed is strong he said at the end his speech was too slurred to comprehend death did not come until the next morning but lord jon was at peace after that he never spoke again ned took another swallow of milk trying not to gag on the sweetness of it did it seem to you that there was anything unnatural about lord arryns death unnatural the aged maesters voice was thin as a whisper no i could not say so sad for a certainty yet in its own way death is the most natural thing of all lord eddard jon arryn rests easy now his burdens lifted at last this illness that took him said ned had you ever seen its like before in other men near forty years i have been grand maester of the seven kingdoms pycelle replied under our good king robert and aerys targaryen before him and his father jaehaerys the second before him and even for a few short months under jaehaeryss father aegon the fortunate the fifth of his name i have seen more of illness than i care to remember my lord i will tell you this every case is different and every case is alike lord jons death was no stranger than any other george ra martin his wife thought otherwise the grand maester nodded i recall now the widow is sister to your own noble wife if an old man may be forgiven his blunt speech let me say that grief can derange even the strongest and most disciplined of minds and the lady lysa was never that since her last stillbirth she has seen enemies in every shadow and the death of her lord husband left her shattered and lost so you are quite certain that jon arryn died of a sudden illness i am pycelle replied gravely if not illness my good lord what else could it be poison ned suggested quietly pycelles sleepy eyes flicked open the aged maester shifted uncomfortably in his seat a disturbing thought we are not the free cities where such things are common grand maester aethelmure wrote that all men carry murder in their hearts yet even so the poisoner is beneath contempt he fell silent for a moment his eyes lost in thought what you suggest is possible my lord yet i do not think it likely every hedge maester knows the common poisons and lord arryn displayed none of the signs and the hand was loved by all what sort of monster in mans flesh would dare to murder such a noble lord i have heard it said that poison is a womans weapon pycelle stroked his beard thoughtfully it is said women cravens and eunuchs he cleared his throat and spat a thick glob of phelm onto the rushes above them a raven cawed loudly in the rookery the lord varys was born a slave in lys did you know put not your trust in spiders my lord that was scarcely anything ned needed to be told there was something about varys that made his flesh crawl i will remember that maester and i thank you for your help i have taken enough of your time he stood grand maester pycelle pushed himself up from his chair slowly and escorted ned to the door i hope i have helped in some small way to put your mind at ease if there is any other service i might perform you need only ask one thing ned told him i should be curious to examine the book that you lent jon the day before he fell ill i fear you would find it of little interest pycelle said it was a ponderous tome by grand maester malleon on the lineages of the great houses still i should like to see it the old man opened the door as you wish i have it here some a gaml of thronls where when i find it i shall have it sent to your chambers straightaway you have been most courteous ned told him then almost as an afterthought he said one last question if you would be so kind you mentioned that the king was at lord arryns bedside when he died i wonder was the queen with him why no pycelle said she and the children were making the journey to casterly rock in company with her father lord tywin had brought a retinue to the city for the tourney on prince joffreys name day no doubt hoping to see his son jaime win the champions crown in that he was sadly disappointed it fell to me to send the queen word of lord arryns sudden death never have i sent off a bird with a heavier heart dark wings dark words ned murmured it was a proverb old nan had taught him as a boy so the fishwives say grand maester pycelle agreed but we know it is not always so when maester luwins bird brought the word about your bran the message lifted every true heart in the castle did it not as you say maester the gods are merciful pycelle bowed his head come to me as often as you like lord eddard i am here to serve yes ned thought as the door swung shut but whom on the way back to his chambers he came upon his daughter arya on the winding steps of the tower of the hand windmilling her arms as she struggled to balance on one leg the rough stone had scuffed her bare feet ned stopped and looked at her arya what are you doing syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours her hands flailed at the air to steady herself ned had to smile which toe he teased any toe arya said exasperated with the question she hopped from her right leg to her left swaying dangerously before she regained her balance must you do your standing here he asked its a long hard fall down these steps syrio says a water dancer never falls she lowered her leg to stand on two feet father will bran come and live with us now not for a long time sweet one he told her he needs to win his strength back arya bit her lip what will bran do when hes of age ned knelt beside her he has years to find that answer arya for now it is enough to know that he will live the night the bird had come from winterfell eddard stark had taken the girls to the castle godswood an acre of elm and alder and black cottonwood overlooking the river the heart tree there was a great oak its ancient limbs overgrown with smokeberry vines they knelt before it to offer their thanksgiving as if it had been a weirwood sansa drifted to sleep as the moon rose arya several hours later curling up in the grass under neds cloak all through the dark hours he kept his vigil alone when dawn broke over the city the dark red blooms of dragons breath surrounded the girls where they lay i dreamed of bran sansa had whispered to him i saw him smiling he was going to be a knight arya was saying now a knight of the kingsguard can he still be a knight no ned said he saw no use in lying to her yet someday he may be the lord of a great holdfast and sit on the kings council he might raise castles like brandon the builder or sail a ship across the sunset sea or enter your mothers faith and become the high septon but he will never run beside his wolf again he thought with a sadness too deep for words or lie with a woman or hold his own son in his arms arya cocked her head to one side can i be a kings councillor and build castles and become the high septon you ned said kissing her lightly on the brow will marry a king and rule his castle and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and yes perhaps even a high septon arya screwed up her face no she said thats sansa she folded up her right leg and resumed her balancing ned sighed and left her there inside his chambers he stripped off his sweat stained silks and sluiced cold water over his head from the basin beside the bed alyn entered as he was drying his face my lord he said lord baelish is without and begs audience escort him to my solar ned said reaching for a fresh tunic the lightest linen he could find ill see him at once littlefinger was perched on the window seat when ned entered watching the knights of the kingsguard practice at swords in the yard below if only old selmys mind were as nimble as his blade he said wistfully our council meetings would be a good deal livelier ser barristan is as valiant and honorable as any man in kings landing ned had come to have a deep respect for the aged whitehaired lord commander of the kingsguard and as tiresome littlefinger added though i daresay he should do well in the tourney last year he unhorsed the hound and it was only four years ago that he was champion the question of who might win the tourney interested eddard stark not in the least is there a reason for this visit lord petyr or are you here simply to enjoy the view from my window littlefinger smiled i promised cat i would help you in your inquiries and so i have that took ned aback promise or no promise he could not find it in him to trust lord petyr baelish who struck him as too clever by half you have something for me someone littlefinger corrected four someones if truth be told had you thought to question the hands servants ned frowned would that i could lady arryn took her household back to the eyrie lysa had done him no favor in that regard all those who had stood closest to her husband had gone with her when she fled jons maester his steward the captain of his guard his knights and retainers most of her household littlefinger said not all a few remain a pregnant kitchen girl hastily wed to one of lord renlys grooms a stablehand who joined the city watch a potboy discharged from service for theft and lord arryns squire his squire ned was pleasantly surprised a mans squire often knew a great deal of his comings and goings ser hugh of the vale littlefinger named him the king knighted the boy after lord arryns death i shall send for him ned said and the others littlefinger winced my lord step over here to the window if you would be so kind why come and ill show you my lord frowning ned crossed to the window petyr baelish made a casual gesture there across the yard at the door of the armory do you see the boy squatting by the steps honing a sword with an oilstone what of him he reports to varys the spider has taken a great interest in you and all your doings he shifted in the window seat now glance at the wall farther west above the stables the guardsman leaning on the ramparts ned saw the man another of the eunuchs whisperers no this one belongs to the queen notice that he enjoys a fine view of the door to this tower the better to note who calls on you there are others many unknown even to me the red keep is full of eyes why do you think i hid cat in a brothel eddard stark had no taste for these intrigues seven hells he swore it did seem as though the man on the wahs was watching him suddenly uncomfortable ned moved away from the window is everyone someones informer in this cursed city scarcely said littlefinger he counted on the fingers on his hand why theres me you the king although come to think on it the king tells the queen much too much and im less than certain about you he stood up is there a man in your service that you trust utterly and completely yes said ned in that case i have a delightful palace in valyria that i would dearly love to sell you littlefinger said with a mocking smile the wiser answer was no my lord but be that as it may send this paragon of yours to ser hugh and the others your own comings and goings will be noted but even varys the spider cannot watch every man in your service every hour of the day he started for the door lord petyr ned called after him i am grateful for your help perhaps i was wrong to distrust you littlefinger fingered his small pointed beard you are slow to learn lord eddard distrusting me was the wisest thing youve done since you climbed down off your horse jon jon was showing dareon how best to deliver a sidestroke when the new recruit entered the practice yard your feet should be farther apart he urged you dont want to lose your balance thats good now pivot as you deliver the stroke get all your weight behind the blade dareon broke off and lifted his visor seven gods he murmured would you look at this jon jon turned through the eye slit of his helm he beheld the fattest boy he had ever seen standing in the door of the armory by the look of him he must have weighed twenty stone the fur collar of his embroidered surcoat was lost beneath his chins pale eyes moved nervously in a great round moon of a face and plump sweaty fingers wiped themselves on the velvet of his doublet they they told me i was to come here for for training he said to no one in particular a lordling pyp observed to jon southron most like near highgarden pyp had traveled the seven kingdoms with a mummers troupe and bragged that he could tell what you were and where youd been born just from the sound of your voice a striding huntsman had been worked in scarlet thread upon the breast of the fat boys fur trimmed surcoat jon did not recognize the sigil ser alliser thorne looked over his new charge and said it would seem they have run short of poachers and thieves down south now they send us pigs to man the wall is fur and velvet your notion of armor my lord of ham it was soon revealed that the new recruit had brought his own armor with him padded doublet boiled leather mail and plate and helm even a great wood and leather shield blazoned with the same striding huntsman he wore on his surcoat as none of it was black however ser alliser insisted that he reequip himself from the armory that took half the morning his girth required donal noye to take apart a mail hauberk and refit it with leather panels at the sides to get a helm over his head the armorer had to detach the visor his leathers bound so tightly around his legs and under his arms that he could scarcely move dressed for battle the new boy looked like an overcooked sausage about to burst its skin let us hope you are not as inept as you look ser alliser said halder see what ser piggy can do jon snow winced halder had been born in a quarry and apprenticed as a stonemason he was sixteen tall and muscular and his blows were as hard as any jon had ever felt this will be uglier than a whores ass pyp muttered and it was the fight lasted less than a minute before the fat boy was on the ground his whole body shaking as blood leaked through his shattered helm and between his pudgy fingers i yield he shrilled no more i yield dont hit me rast and some of the other boys were laughing even then ser alliser would not call an end on your feet ser piggy he called pick up your sword when the boy continued to cling to the ground thorne gestured to halder hit him with the flat of your blade until he finds his feet halder delivered a tentative smack to his foes upraised cheeks you can hit harder than that thorne taunted halder took hold of his longsword with both hands and brought it down so hard the blow split leather even on the flat the new boy screeched in pain jon snow took a step forward pyp laid a mailed hand on his arm jon no the small boy whispered with an anxious glance at ser alliser thorne on your feet thorne repeated the fat boy struggled to rise slipped and fell heavily again ser piggy is starting to grasp the notion ser alliser observed again halder lifted the sword for another blow cut us off a ham rast urged laughing jon shook off pyps hand halder enough halder looked to ser alliser the bastard speaks and the peasants tremble the master at arms said in that sharp cold voice of his i remind you that i am the master at arms here lord snow look at him haider jon urged ignoring thorne as best he could theres no honor in beating a fallen foe he yielded he knelt beside the fat boy haider lowered his sword he yielded he echoed ser allisers onyx eyes were fixed on jon snow it would seem our bastard is in love he said as jon helped the fat boy to his feet show me your steel lord snow jon drew his longsword he dared defy ser alliser only to a point and he feared he was well beyond it now thorne smiled the bastard wishes to defend his lady love so we shall make an exercise of it rat pimple help our stone head here rast and albett moved to join haider three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal all you need do is get past the bastard stay behind me jon said to the fat boy ser alliser had often sent two foes against him but never three he knew he would likely go to sleep bruised and bloody tonight he braced himself for the assault suddenly pyp was beside him three to two will make for better sport the small boy said cheerfully he dropped his visor and slid out his sword before jon could even think to protest grenn had stepped up to make a third the yard had grown deathly quiet jon could feel ser allisers eyes why are you waiting he asked rast and the others in a voice gone deceptively soft but it was jon who moved first haider barely got his sword up in time jon drove him backward attacking with every blow keeping the older boy on the heels know your foe ser rodrik had taught him once jon knew haider brutally strong but short of patience with no taste for defense frustrate him and he would leave himself open as certain as sunset the clang of steel echoed through the yard as the others joined battle around him jon blocked a savage cut at his head the shock of impact running up his arm as the swords crashed together he slammed a sidestroke into haiders ribs and was rewarded with a muffled grunt of pain the counterstroke caught jon on the shoulder chainmail crunched and pain flared up his neck but for an instant haider was unbalanced jon cut his left leg from under him and he fell with a curse and a crash grenn was standing his ground as jon had taught him giving albett more than he cared for but pyp was hard pressed rast had two years george r r martin and forty pounds on him jon stepped up behind him and rang the rapers helm like a bell as rast went reeling pyp slid in under his guard knocked him down and leveled a blade at his throat by then jon had moved on facing two swords albett backed away i yield he shouted ser alliser thorne surveyed the scene with disgust the mummers farce has gone on long enough for today he walked away the session was at an end dareon helped halder to his feet the quarrymans son wrenched off his helm and threw it across the yard for an instant i thought i finally had you snow for an instant you did jon replied under his mail and leather his shoulder was throbbing he sheathed his sword and tried to remove his helm but when he raised his arm the pain made him grit his teeth let me a voice said thick fingered hands unfastened helm from gorget and lifted it off gently did he hurt you ive been bruised before he touched his shoulder and winced the yard was emptying around them blood matted the fat boys hair where halder had split his helm asunder my name is samwell tarly of horn he stopped and licked his lips i mean i was of horn hill until i left ive come to take the black my father is lord randyll a bannerman to the tyrells of highgarden i used to be his heir only his voice trailed off im jon snow ned starks bastard of winterfell samwell tarly nodded i my mother calls me sam you can call him lord snow pyp said as he came up to join them you dont want to know what his mother calls him these two are grenn and pypar jon said grenns the ugly one pyp said grenn scowled youre uglier than me at least i dont have ears like a bat my thanks to all of you the fat boy said gravely why didnt you get up and fight grenn demanded i wanted to truly i just i couldnt i didnt want him to hit me anymore he looked at the ground i my lord father always said so grenn looked thunderstruck even pyp had no words to say to that and pyp had words for everything what sort of man would proclaim himself a coward samwell tarly must have read their thoughts on their faces his eyes if you want you can call me sam i fear im a coward met jons and darted away quick as frightened animals i im sorry he said i dont mean to to be like i am he walked heavily toward the armory jon called after him you were hurt he said tomorrow youll do better sam looked mournfully back over one shoulder no i wont he said blinking back tears i never do better when he was gone grenn frowned nobody likes cravens he said uncomfortably i wish we hadnt helped him what if they think were craven too youre too stupid to be craven pyp told him i am not grenn said yes you are if a bear attacked you in the woods youd be too stupid to run away i would not grenn insisted id run away faster than you he stopped suddenly scowling when he saw pyps grin and realized what hed just said his thick neck flushed a dark red jon left them there arguing as he returned to the armory hung up his sword and stripped off his battered armor life at castle black followed certain patterns the mornings were for swordplay the afternoons for work the black brothers set new recruits to many different tasks to learn where their skills lay jon cherished the rare afternoons when he was sent out with ghost ranging at his side to bring back game for the lord commanders table but for every day spent hunting he gave a dozen to donal noye in the armory spinning the whetstone while the one armed smith sharpened axes grown dull from use or pumping the bellows as noye hammered out a new sword other times he ran messages stood at guard mucked out stables fletched arrows assisted maester aemon with his birds or bowen marsh with his counts and inventories that afternoon the watch commander sent him to the winch cage with four barrels of fresh crushed stone to scatter gravel over the icy footpaths atop the wall it was lonely and boring work even with ghost along for company but jon found he did not mind on a clear day you could see half the world from the top of the wall and the air was always cold and bracing he could think here and he found himself thinking of samwell tarly and oddly of tyrion lannister he wondered what tyrion would have made of the fat boy most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it the dwarf had told him grinning the world was full of cravens who pretended to be heroes it took a queer sort of courage to admit to cowardice as samwell tarly had his sore shoulder made the work go slowly it was late afternoon before jon finished graveling the paths he lingered on high to watch the sun go down turning the western sky the color of blood finally as dusk was settling over the north jon rolled the empty barrels back into the cage and signaled the winch men to lower him the evening meal was almost done by the time he and ghost reached the common hall a group of the black brothers were dicing over mulled wine near the fire his friends were at the bench nearest the west wall laughing pyp was in the middle of a story the mummers boy with the big ears was a born liar with a hundred different voices and he did not tell his tales so much as live them playing all the parts as needed a king one moment and a swineherd the next when he turned into an alehouse girl or a virgin princess he used a high falsetto voice that reduced them all to tears of helpless laughter and his eunuchs were always eerily accurate caricatures of ser alliser jon took as much pleasure from pyps antics as anyone yet that night he turned away and went instead to the end of the bench where samwell tarly sat alone as far from the others as he could get he was finishing the last of the pork pie the cooks had served up for supper when jon sat down across from him the fat boys eyes widened at the sight of ghost is that a wolf a direwolf jon said his name is ghost the direwolf is the sigil of my fathers house ours is a striding huntsman samwell tarly said do you like to hunt the fat boy shuddered i hate it he looked as though he was going to cry again whats wrong now jon asked him why are you always so frightened sam stared at the last of his pork pie and gave a feeble shake of his head too scared even to talk a burst of laughter filled the hall jon heard pyp squeaking in a high voice he stood lets go outside the round fat face looked up at him suspicious why what will we do outside talk jon said have you seen the wall im fat not blind samwell tarly said of course i saw it its seven hundred feet high yet he stood up all the same wrapped a furlined cloak over his shoulders and followed jon from the common hall still wary as if he suspected some cruel trick was waiting for him in the night ghost padded along beside them i never thought it would be like this sam said as they walked his words steaming in the a gaml of thronfs cold air already he was huffing and puffing as he tried to keep up all the buildings are falling down and its so so cold a hard frost was settling over the castle and jon could hear the soft crunch of grey weeds beneath his boots sam nodded miserably i hate the cold he said last night i woke up in the dark and the fire had gone out and i was certain i was going to freeze to death by morning it must have been warmer where you come from i never saw snow until last month we were crossing the barrowlands me and the men my father sent to see me north and this white stuff began to fall like a soft rain at first i thought it was so beautiful like feathers drifting from the sky but it kept on and on until i was frozen to the bone the men had crusts of snow in their beards and more on their shoulders and still it kept coming i was afraid it would never end jon smiled the wall loomed before them glimmering palely in the light of the half moon in the sky above the stars burned clear and sharp are they going to make me go up there sam asked his face curdled like old milk as he looked at the great wooden stairs ill die if i have to climb that theres a winch jon said pointing they can draw you up in a cage samwell tarly sniffled i dont like high places it was too much jon frowned incredulous are you afraid of everything he asked i dont understand if you are truly so craven why are you here why would a coward want to join the nights watch samwell tarly looked at him for a long moment and his round face seemed to cave in on itself he sat down on the frost covered ground and began to cry huge choking sobs that made his whole body shake jon snow could only stand and watch like the snowfall on the barrowlands it seemed the tears would never end it was ghost who knew what to do silent as shadow the pale direwolf moved closer and began to lick the warm tears off samwell tarlys face the fat boy cried out startled and somehow in a heartbeat his sobs turned to laughter jon snow laughed with him afterward they sat on the frozen ground huddled in their cloaks with ghost between them jon told the story of how he and robb had found the pups newborn in the late summer snows it seemed a thousand years ago now before long he found himself talking of winterfell sometimes i dream about it he said im walking down this long empty hall my voice echoes all around but no one answers so i walk faster opening doors shouting names i dont even know who im looking for most nights its my father but sometimes its robb instead or my little sister arya or my uncle the thought of benjen stark saddened him his uncle was still missing the old bear had sent out rangers in search of him ser jaremy rykker had led two sweeps and quorin halfhand had gone forth from the shadow tower but theyd found nothing aside from a few blazes in the trees that his uncle had left to mark his way in the stony highlands to the northwest the marks stopped abruptly and all trace of ben stark vanished do you ever find anyone in your dream sam asked jon shook his head no one the castle is always empty he had never told anyone of the dream and he did not understand why he was telling sam now yet somehow it felt good to talk of it even the ravens are gone from the rookery and the stables are full of bones that always scares me i start to run then throwing open doors climbing the tower three steps at a time screaming for someone for anyone and then i find myself in front of the door to the crypts its black inside and i can see the steps spiraling down somehow i know i have to go down there but i dont want to im afraid of what might be waiting for me the old kings of winter are down there sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their feet and iron swords across their laps but its not them im afraid of i scream that im not a stark that this isnt my place but its no good i have to go anyway so i start down feeling the walls as i descend with no torch to light the way it gets darker and darker until i want to scream he stopped frowning embarrassed thats when i always wake his skin cold and clammy shivering in the darkness of his cell ghost would leap up beside him his warmth as comforting as daybreak he would go back to sleep with his face pressed into the direwolf s shaggy white fur do you dream of horn hill jon asked no sams mouth grew tight and hard i hated it there he scratched ghost behind the ear brooding and jon let the silence breathe after a long while samwell tarly began to talk and jon snow listened quietly and learned how it was that a self confessed coward found himself on the wall the tarlys were a family old in honor bannermen to mace tyrell lord of highgarden and warden of the south the eldest son of lord randyll tarly samwell was born heir to rich lands a strong keep and a storied two handed greatsword named heartsbane forged of valyrian steel and passed down from father to son near five hundred years whatever pride his lord father might have felt at samwells birth vanished as the boy grew up plump soft and awkward sam loved to listen to music and make his own songs to wear soft velvets to play in the castle kitchen beside the cooks drinking in the rich smells as he snitched lemon cakes and blueberry tarts his passions were books and kittens and dancing clumsy as he was but he grew ill at the sight of blood and wept to see even a chicken slaughtered a dozen mastersat arms came and went at horn hill trying to turn samwell into the knight his father wanted the boy was cursed and caned slapped and starved one man had him sleep in his chainmail to make him more martial another dressed him in his mothers clothing and paraded him through the bailey to shame him into valor he only grew fatter and more frightened until lord randylls disappointment turned to anger and then to loathing one time sam confided his voice dropping from a whisper two men came to the castle warlocks from qarth with white skin and blue lips they slaughtered a bull aurochs and made me bathe in the hot blood but it didnt make me brave as theyd promised i got sick and retched father had them scourged finally after three girls in as many years lady tarly gave her lord husband a second son from that day lord randyll ignored sam devoting all his time to the younger boy a fierce robust child more to his liking samwell had known several years of sweet peace with his music and his books until the dawn of his fifteenth name day when he had been awakened to find his horse saddled and ready three men at arms had escorted him into a wood near horn hill where his father was skinning a deer you are almost a man grown now and my heir lord randyll tarly had told his eldest son his long knife laying bare the carcass as he spoke you have given me no cause to disown you but neither will i allow you to inherit the land and title that should be dickons heartsbane must go to a man strong enough to wield her and you are not worthy to touch her hilt so i have decided that you shall this day announce that you wish to take the black you will forsake all claim to your brothers inheritance and start north before evenfall if you do not then on the morrow we shall have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you will be thrown from the saddle to die or so i will tell your mother she has a womans heart and finds it in her to cherish even you and i have no wish to cause her pain please do not imagine that it will truly be that easy should you think to defy me nothing would please me more than to hunt you down like the pig you are his arms were red to the elbow as he laid the skinning knife aside so there is your choice the nights watch he reached inside the deer ripped out its heart and held it in his fist red and dripping or this sam told the tale in a calm dead voice as if it were something that had happened to someone else not to him and strangely jon thought he did not weep not even once when he was done they sat together and listened to the wind for a time there was no other sound in all the world finally jon said we should go back to the common hall why sam asked jon shrugged theres hot cider to drink or mulled wine if you prefer some nights dareon sings for us if the mood is on him he was a singer before well not truly but almost an apprentice singer how did he come here sam asked lord rowan of goldengrove found him in bed with his daughter the girl was two years older and dareon swears she helped him through her window but under her fathers eye she named it rape so here he is when maester aemon heard him sing he said his voice was honey poured over thunder jon smiled toad sometimes sings too if you call it singing drinking songs he learned in his fathers winesink pyp says his voice is piss poured over a fart they laughed at that together i should like to hear them both sam admitted but they would not want me there his face was troubled hes going to make me fight again on the morrow isnt he he is jon was forced to say sam got awkwardly to his feet i had better try to sleep he huddled down in his cloak and plodded off the others were still in the common room when jon returned alone but for ghost where haveyou been pyp asked talking with sam he said he truly is craven said grenn at supper there were still places on the bench when he got his pie but he was too scared to come sit with us the lord of ham thinks hes too good to eat with the likes of us suggested jeren i saw him eat a pork pie toad said smirking do you think it was a brother he began to make oinking noises stop it jon snapped angrily the other boys fell silent taken aback by his sudden fury listen to me jon said into the quiet and he told them how it was going to be pyp backed him as hed known he would but when halder spoke up it was a pleasant surprise grenn was anxious at the first but jon knew the words to move him one by one the rest fell in line jon persuaded some cajoled some shamed the others made threats where threats were required at the end they had all agreed all but rast you girls do as you please rast said but if thorne sends me against lady piggy im going to slice me off a rasher of bacon he laughed in jons face and left them there hours later as the castle slept three of them paid a call on his cell grenn held his arms while pyp sat on his legs jon could hear rasts rapid breathing as ghost leapt onto his chest the direwolfs eyes burned red as embers as his teeth nipped lightly at the soft skin of the boys throat just enough to draw blood remember we know where you sleep jon said softly the next morning jon heard rast tell albett and toad how his razor had slipped while he shaved from that day forth neither rast nor any of the others would hurt samwell tarly when ser alliser matched them against him they would stand their ground and swat aside his slow clumsy strokes if the master at arms screamed for an attack they would dance in and tap sam lightly on breastplate or helm or leg ser alliser raged and threatened and called them all cravens and women and worse yet sam remained unhurt a few nights later at jons urging he joined them for the evening meal taking a place on the bench beside halder it was another fortnight before he found the nerve to join their talk but in time he was laughing at pyps faces and teasing grenn with the best of them fat and awkward and frightened he might be but samwell tarly was no fool one night he visited jon in his cell i dont know what you did he said but i know you did it he looked away shyly ive never had a friend before were not friends jon said he put a hand on sams broad shoulder were brothers and so they were he thought to himself after sam had taken his leave robb and bran and rickon were his fathers sons and he loved them still yet jon knew that he had never truly been one of them catelyn stark had seen to that the grey walls of winterfell might still haunt his dreams but castle black was his life now and his brothers were sam and grenn and halder and pyp and the other cast outs who wore the black of the nights watch my uncle spoke truly he whispered to ghost he wondered if he would ever see benjen stark again to tell him eddard its the hands tourney thats the cause of all the trouble my lords the commander of the city watch complained to the kings council the kings tourney ned corrected wincing i assure you the hand wants no part of it call it what you will my lord knights have been arriving from all over the realm and for every knight we get two freeriders three craftsmen six men at arms a dozen merchants two dozen whores and more thieves than i dare guess this cursed heat had half the city in a fever to start and now with all these visitors last night we had a drowning a tavern riot three knife fights a rape two fires robberies beyond count and a drunken horse race down the street of the sisters the night before a womans head was found in the great sept floating in the rainbow pool no one seems to know how it got there or who it belongs to how dreadful varys said with a shudder lord renly baratheon was less sympathetic if you cannot keep the kings peace janos perhaps the city watch should be commanded by someone who can stout jowly janos slynt puffed himself up like an angry frog his bald pate reddening aegon the dragon himself could not keep the peace lord renly i need more men how many ned asked leaning forward as ever robert had not troubled himself to attend the council session so it fell to his hand to speak for him as many as can be gotten lord hand hire fifty new men ned told him lord baelish will see that you get the coin i will littlefinger said you will you found forty thousand golden dragons for a champions purse surely you can scrape together a few coppers to keep the kings peace ned turned back to janos slynt i will also give you twenty good swords from my own household guard to serve with the watch until the crowds have left all thanks lord hand slynt said bowing i promise you they shall be put to good use when the commander had taken his leave eddard stark turned to the rest of the council the sooner this folly is done with the better i shall like it as if the expense and trouble were not irksome enough all and sundry insisted on salting neds wound by calling it the hands tourney as if he were the cause of it and robert honestly seemed to think he should feel honored the realm prospers from such events my lord grand maester pycelle said they bring the great the chance of glory and the lowly a respite from their woes and put coins in many a pocket littlefinger added every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bowlegged and jingling with each step lord renly laughed were fortunate my brother stannis is not with us remember the time he proposed to outlaw brothels the king asked him if perhaps hed like to outlaw eating shitting and breathing while he was at it if truth be told i ofttimes wonder how stannis ever got that ugly daughter of his he goes to his marriage bed like a man marching to a battlefield with a grim look in his eyes and a determination to do his duty ned had not joined the laughter i wonder about your brother stannis as well i wonder when he intends to end his visit to dragonstone and resume his seat on this council no doubt as soon as weve scourged all those whores into the sea littlefinger replied provoking more laughter i have heard quite enough about whores for one day ned said rising until the morrow harwin had the door when ned returned to the tower of the hand summon jory to my chambers and tell your father to saddle my horse ned told him too brusquely as you say my lord the red keep and the hands tourney were chafing him raw ned reflected as he climbed he yearned for the comfort of catelyns arms for the sounds of robb and jon crossing swords in the practice yard for the cool days and cold nights of the north in his chambers he stripped off his council silks and sat for a moment with the book while he waited for jory to arrive the lineages and histories of the great houses of the seven kingdoms with descliptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children by grand maester malleon pycelle had spoken truly it made for ponderous reading yet jon arryn had asked for it and ned felt certain he had reasons there was something here some truth buried in these brittle yellow pages if only he could see it but what the tome was over a century old scarcely a man now alive had yet been born when malleon had compiled his dusty lists of weddings births and deaths he opened to the section on house lannister once more and turned the pages slowly hoping against hope that something would leap out at him the lannisters were an old family tracing their descent back to lann the clever a trickster from the age of heroes who was no doubt as legendary as bran the builder though far more beloved of singers and taletellers in the songs lann was the fellow who winkled the casterlys out of casterly rock with no weapon but his wits and stole gold from the sun to brighten his curly hair ned wished he were here now to winkle the truth out of this damnable book a sharp rap on the door heralded jory cassel ned closed malleons tome and bid him enter ive promised the city watch twenty of my guard until the tourney is done he told him i rely on you to make the choice give alyn the command and make certain the men understand that they are needed to stop fights not start them rising ned opened a cedar chest and removed a light linen undertunic did you find the stableboy the watchman my lord jory said he vows hell never touch another horse what did he have to say he claims he knew lord arryn well fast friends they were jory snorted the hand always gave the lads a copper on their name days he says had a way with horses never rode his mounts too hard and brought them carrots and apples so they were always pleased to see him carrots and apples ned repeated it sounded as if this boy would be even less use than the others and he was the last of the four littlefinger had turned up jory had spoken to each of them in turn ser hugh had been brusque and uninformative and arrogant as only a new made knight can be if the hand wished to talk to him he should be pleased to receive him but he would not be questioned by a mere captain of guards even if said captain was ten years older and a hundred times the swordsman the serving girl had at least been pleasant she said lord jon had been reading more than was good for him that he was troubled and melancholy over his young sons frailty and gruff with his lady wife the potboy now cordwainer had never exchanged so much as a word with lord jon but he was full of oddments of kitchen gossip the lord had been quarreling with the king the lord only picked at his food the lord was sending his boy to be fostered on dragonstone the lord had taken a great interest in the breeding of hunting hounds the lord had visited a master armorer to commission a new suit of plate wrought all in pale silver with a blue jasper falcon and a mother of pearl moon on the breast the kings own brother had gone with him to help choose the design the potboy said no not lord renly the other one lord stannis did our watchman recall anything else of note the lad swears lord jon was as strong as a man half his age often went riding with lord stannis he says stannis again ned thought he found that curious jon arryn and he had been cordial but never friendly and while robert had been riding north to winterfell stannis had removed himself to dragonstone the targaryen island fastness he had conquered in his brothers name he had given no word as to when he might return where did they go on these rides ned asked the boy says that they visited a brothel a brothel ned said the lord of the eyrie and hand of the king visited a brothel with stannis baratheon he shook his head incredulous wondering what lord renly would make of this tidbit roberts lusts were the subject of ribald drinking songs throughout the realm but stannis was a different sort of man a bare year younger than the king yet utterly unlike him stern humorless unforgiving grim in his sense of duty the boy insists its true the hand took three guardsmen with him and the boy says they were joking of it when he took their horses afterward which brothel ned asked the boy did not know the guards would a pity lysa carried them off to the vale ned said dryly the gods are doing their best to vex us lady lysa maester colemon lord stannis everyone who might actually know the truth of what happened to jon arryn is a thousand leagues away will you summon lord stannis back from dragonstone not yet ned said not until i have a better notion of what this is all about and where he stands the matter nagged at him why did stannis leave had he played some part in jon arryns murder or was he afraid ned found it hard to imagine what could frighten stannis baratheon who had once held storms end through a year of siege surviving on rats and boot leather while the lords tyrell and redwyne sat outside with their hosts banqueting in sight of his walls bring me my doublet if you would the grey with the direwolf sigil i want this armorer to know who i am it might make him more forthcoming jory went to the wardrobe lord renly is brother to lord stannis as well as the king yet it seems that he was not invited on these rides ned was not sure what to make of renly with all his friendly ways and easy smiles a few days past he had taken ned aside to show him an exquisite rose gold locklet inside was a miniature painted in the vivid myrish style of a lovely young girl with does eyes and a cascade of soft brown hair renly had seemed anxious to know if the girl reminded him of anyone and when ned had no answer but a shrug he had seemed disappointed the maid was loras tyrells sister margaery hed confessed but there were those who said she looked like lyanna no ned had told him bemused could it be that lord renly who looked so like a young robert had conceived a passion for a girl he fancied to be a young lyanna that struck him as more than passing queer jory held out the doublet and ned slid his hands through the armholes perhaps lord stannis will return for roberts tourney he said as jory laced the garment up the back that would be a stroke of fortune my lord jory said ned buckled on a longsword in other words not bloody likely his smile was grim jory draped neds cloak across his shoulders and clasped it at the throat with the hands badge of office the armorer lives above his shop in a large house at the top of the street of steel alyn knows the way my lord ned nodded the gods help this potboy if hes sent me off haring after shadows it was a slim enough staff to lean on but the jon arryn that ned stark had known was not one to wear jeweled and silvered plate steel was steel it was meant for protection not ornament he a gaml of thronls might have changed his views to be sure he would scarcely have been the first man who came to look on things differently after a few years at court but the change was marked enough to make ned wonder is there any other service i might perform i suppose youd best begin visiting whorehouses hard duty my lord jory grinned the men will be glad to help porther has made a fair start already neds favorite horse was saddled and waiting in the yard varly and jacks fell in beside him as he rode through the yard their steel caps and shirts of mail must have been sweltering yet they said no word of complaint as lord eddard passed beneath the kings gate into the stink of the city his grey and white cloak streaming from his shoulders he saw eyes everywhere and kicked his mount into a trot his guard followed he looked behind him frequently as they made their way through the crowded city streets tomard and desmond had left the castle early this morning to take up positions on the route they must take and watch for anyone following them but even so ned was uncertain the shadow of the kings spider and his little birds had him fretting like a maiden on her wedding night the street of steel began at the market square beside the river gate as it was named on maps or the mud gate as it was commonly called a mummer on stilts was striding through the throngs like some great insect with a horde of barefoot children trailing behind him hooting elsewhere two ragged boys no older than bran were dueling with sticks to the loud encouragement of some and the furious curses of others an old woman ended the contest by leaning out of her window and emptying a bucket of slops on the heads of the combatants in the shadow of the wall farmers stood beside their wagons bellowing out apples the best apples cheap at twice the price and blood melons sweet as honey and turnips onions roots here you go here here you go turnips onions roots here you go here the mud gate was open and a squad of city watchmen stood under the portcullis in their golden cloaks leaning on spears when a column of riders appeared from the west the guardsmen sprang into action shouting commands and moving the carts and foot traffic aside to let the knight enter with his escort the first rider through the gate carried a long black banner the silk rippled in the wind like a living thing across the fabric was blazoned a night sky slashed with purple lightning make way for lord beric the rider shouted make wayfor lord befic and close behind came the young lord himself a dashing i figure on a black courser with red gold hair and a black satin cloak dusted with stars here to fight in the hands tourney my lord a guardsman called out to him here to win the hands tourney lord beric shouted back as the crowd cheered ned turned off the square where the street of steel began and followed its winding path up a long hill past blacksmiths working at open forges freeriders haggling over mail shirts and grizzled ironmongers selling old blades and razors from their wagons the farther they climbed the larger the buildings grew the man they wanted was all the way at the top of the hill in a huge house of timber and plaster whose upper stories loomed over the narrow street the double doors showed a hunting scene carved in ebony and weirwood a pair of stone knights stood sentry at the entrance armored in fanciful suits of polished red steel that transformed them into griffin and unicorn ned left his horse with jacks and shouldered his way inside the slim young serving girl took quick note of neds badge and the sigil on his doublet and the master came hurrying out all smiles and bows wine for the kings hand he told the girl gesturing ned to a couch i am tobho mott my lord please please put yourself at ease he wore a black velvet coat with hammers embroidered on the sleeves in silver thread around his neck was a heavy silver chain and a sapphire as large as a pigeons egg if you are in need of new arms for the hands tourney you have come to the right shop ned did not bother to correct him my work is costly and i make no apologies for that my lord he said as he filled two matching silver goblets you will not find craftsmanship equal to mine anywhere in the seven kingdoms i promise you visit every forge in kings landing if you like and compare for yourself any village smith can hammer out a shift of mail my work is art ned sipped his wine and let the man go on the knight of flowers bought all his armor here tobho boasted and many high lords the ones who knew fine steel and even lord renly the kings own brother perhaps the hand had seen lord renlys new armor the green plate with the golden antlers no other armorer in the city could get that deep a green he knew the secret of putting color in the steel itself paint and enamel were the crutches of a journeyman or mayhaps the hand wanted a blade tobho had learned to work valyrian steel at the forges of oohor as a boy only a man who knew the spells could take old weapons and forge them anew the direwolf was the sigil of house stark is it not i could fashion a direwolf helm so real that children will run from you in the street he vowed ned smiled did you make a falcon helm for lord arryn tobho mott paused a long moment and set aside his wine the hand did call upon me with lord stannis the kings brother i regret to say they did not honor me with their patronage ned looked at the man evenly saying nothing waiting he had found over the years that silence sometimes yielded more than questions and so it was this time they asked to see the boy the armorer said so i took them back to the forge the boy ned echoed he had no notion who the boy might be i should like to see the boy as well tobho mott gave him a cool careful look as you wish my lord he said with no trace of his former friendliness he led ned out a rear door and across a narrow yard back to the cavernous stone barn where the work was done when the armorer opened the door the blast of hot air that came through made ned feel as though he were walking into a dragons mouth inside a forge blazed in each corner and the air stank of smoke and sulfur journeymen armorers glanced up from their hammers and tongs just long enough to wipe the sweat from their brows while bare chested apprentice boys worked the bellows the master called over a tall lad about robbs age his arms and chest corded with muscle this is lord stark the new hand of the king he told him as the boy looked at ned through sullen blue eyes and pushed back sweat soaked hair with his fingers thick hair shaggy and unkempt and black as ink the shadow of a new beard darkened his jaw this is gendry strong for his age and he works hard show the hand that helmet you made lad almost shyly the boy led them to his bench and a steel helm shaped like a bulls head with two great curving horns ned turned the helm over in his hands it was raw steel unpolished but expertly shaped this is fine work i would be pleased if you would let me buy it the boy snatched it out of his hands its not for sale tobho mott looked horror struck boy this is the kings hand if his lordship wants this helm make him a gift of it he honors you by asking i made it for me the boy said stubbornly a hundred pardons my lord his master said hurriedly to ned the boy is crude as new steel and like new steel would profit from some beating that helm is journeymans work at best forgive him and i promise i will craft you a helm like none you have ever seen hes done nothing that requires my forgiveness gendry when lord arryn came to see you what did you talk about he asked me questions is all mlord what sort of questions the boy shrugged how was and was i well treated and if i liked the work and stuff about my mother who she was and what she looked like and all what did you tell him ned asked the boy shoved a fresh fall of black hair off his forehead she died when i was little she had yellow hair and sometimes she used to sing to me i remember she worked in an alehouse did lord stannis question you as well the bald one no not him he never said no word just glared at me like i was some raper who done for his daughter mind your filthy tongue the master said this is the kings own hand the boy lowered his eyes a smart boy but stubborn that helm the others call him bullheaded so he threw it in their teeth ned touched the boys head fingering the thick black hair look at me gendry the apprentice lifted his face ned studied the shape of his jaw the eyes like blue ice yes he thought i see it go back to your work lad im sorry to have bothered you he walked back to the house with the master who paid the boys apprentice fee he asked lightly mott looked fretful you saw the boy such a strong boy those hands of his those hands were made for hammers he had such promise i took him on without a fee the truth now ned urged the streets are full of strong boys the day you take on an apprentice without a fee will be the day the wall comes down who paid for him a lord the master said reluctantly he gave no name and wore no sigil on his coat he paid in gold twice the customary sum and said he was paying once for the boy and once for my silence describe him he was stout round of shoulder not so tall as you brown beard but there was a bit of red in it ill swear he wore a rich cloak that i do remember heavy purple velvet worked with silver threads but the hood shadowed his face and i never did see him clear he hesitated a moment my lord i want no trouble none of us wants trouble but i fear these are troubled times master mott ned said you know who the boy is i am only an armorer my lord i know what im told you know who the boy is ned repeated patiently that is not a question the boy is my apprentice the master said he looked ned in the eye stubborn as old iron who he was before he came to me thats none of my concern ned nodded he decided that he liked tobho mott master armorer if the day ever comes when gendry would rather wield a sword than forge one send him to me he has the look of a warrior until then you have my thanks master mott and my promise should i ever want a helm to frighten children this will be the first place i visit his guard was waiting outside with the horses did you find anything my lord jacks asked as ned mounted up i did ned told him wondering what had jon arryn wanted with a kings bastard and why was it worth his life catelyn my lady you ought cover your head ser rodrik told her as their horses plodded north you will take a chill it is only water ser rodrik catelyn replied her hair hung wet and heavy a loose strand stuck to her forehead and she could imagine how ragged and wild she must look but for once she did not care the southern rain was soft and warm catelyn liked the feel of it on her face gentle as a mothers kisses it took her back to her childhood to long grey days at riverrun she remembered the godswood drooping branches heavy with moisture and the sound of her brothers laughter as he chased her through piles of damp leaves she remembered making mud pies with lysa the weight of them the mud slick and brown between her fingers they had served them to littlefinger giggling and hed eaten so much mud he was sick for a week how young they all had been catelyn had almost forgotten in the north the rain fell cold and hard and sometimes at night it turned to ice it was as likely to kill a crop as nurture it and it sent grown men running for the nearest shelter that was no rain for little girls to play in i am soaked through ser rodrik complained even my bones are wet the woods pressed close around them and the steady pattering of rain on leaves was accompanied by the small sucking sounds their horses made as their hooves pulled free of the mud we will want a fire tonight my lady and a hot meal would serve us both there is an inn at the crossroads up ahead catelyn told him she had slept many a night there in her youth traveling with her father lord hoster tully had been a restless man in his prime always riding somewhere she still remembered the innkeep a fat woman named masha heddle who chewed sourleaf night and day and seemed to have an endless supply of smiles and sweet cakes for the children the sweet cakes had been soaked with honey rich and heavy on the tongue but how catelyn had dreaded those smiles the sourleaf had stained mashas teeth a dark red and made her smile a bloody horror an inn ser rodrik repeated wistfully if only but we dare not risk it if we wish to remain unknown i think it best we seek out some small holdfast he broke off as they heard sounds up the road splashing water the clink of mail a horses whinny riders he warned his hand dropping to the hilt of his sword even on the kingsroad it never hurt to be wary they followed the sounds around a lazy bend of the road and saw them a column of armed men noisily fording a swollen stream catelyn reined up to let them pass the banner in the hand of the foremost rider hung sodden and limp but the guardsmen wore indigo cloaks and on their shoulders flew the silver eagle of seagard mallisters ser rodrik whispered to her as if she had not known my lady best pull up your hood catelyn made no move lord jason mallister himself rode with them surrounded by his knights his son patrek by his side and their squires close behind they were riding for kings landing and the hands tourney she knew for the past week the travelers had been thick as flies upon the kingsroad knights and freeriders singers with their harps and drums heavy wagons laden with hops or corn or casks of honey traders and craftsmen and whores and all of them moving south she studied lord jason boldly the last time she had seen him he had been jesting with her uncle at her wedding feast the mallisters stood bannermen to the tullys and his gifts had been lavish his brown hair was salted with white now his face chiseled gaunt by time yet the years had not touched his pride he rode like a man who feared nothing catelyn envied him that she had come to fear so much as the riders passed lord jason nodded a curt greeting but it was only a high lords courtesy to strangers chance met on the road there was no recognition in those fierce eyes and his son did not even waste a look he did not know you ser rodrik said after wondering he saw a pair of mud spattered travelers by the side of the road wet and tired it would never occur to him to suspect that one of them was the daughter of his liege lord i think we shall be safe enough at the inn ser rodrik it was near dark when they reached it at the crossroads north of the great confluence of the trident masha heddle was fatter and greyer than catelyn remembered still chewing her sourleaf but she gave them only the most cursory of looks with nary a hint of her ghastly red smile two rooms at the top of the stair thats all there is she said chewing all the while theyre under the bell tower you wont be missing meals though theres some thinks it too noisy cant be helped were full up or near as makes no matter its those rooms or the road it was those rooms low dusty garrets at the top of a cramped narrow staircase leave your boots down here masha told them after shed taken their coin the boy will clean them i wont have you tracking mud up my stairs mind the bell those who come late to meals dont eat there were no smiles and no mention of sweet cakes when the supper bell rang the sound was deafening catelyn had changed into dry clothes she sat by the window watching rain run down the pane the glass was milky and full of bubbles and a wet dusk was falling outside catelyn could just make out the muddy crossing where the two great roads met the crossroads gave her pause if they turned west from here it was an easy ride down to riverrun her father had always given her wise counsel when she needed it most and she yearned to talk to him to warn him of the gathering storm if winterfell needed to brace for war how much more so riverrun so much closer to kings landing with the power of casterly rock looming to the west like a shadow if only her father had been stronger she might have chanced it but hoster tully had been bedridden these past two years and catelyn was loath to tax him now the eastern road was wilder and more dangerous climbing through rocky foothills and thick forests into the mountains of the moon past high passes and deep chasms to the vale of arryn and the stony fingers beyond above the vale the eyrie stood high and impregnable its towers reaching for the sky there she would find her sister and perhaps some of the answers ned sought surely lysa knew more than she had dared to put in her letter she might have the very proof that ned needed to bring the lannisters to ruin and if it came to war they would need the arryns and the eastern lords who owed them service yet the mountain road was perilous shadowcats prowled those passes rock slides were common and the mountain clans were lawless brigands descending from the heights to rob and kill and melting away like snow whenever the knights rode out from the vale in search of them even jon arryn as great a lord as any the eyrie had ever known had always traveled in strength when he crossed the mountains catelyns only strength was one elderly knight armored in loyalty no she thought riverrun and the eyrie would have to wait her path ran north to winterfell where her sons and her duty were waiting for her as soon as they were safely past the neck she could declare herself to one of neds bannermen and send riders racing ahead with orders to mount a watch on the kingsroad the rain obscured the fields beyond the crossroads but catelyn saw the land clear enough in her memory the marketplace was just across the way and the village a mile farther on half a hundred white cottages surrounding a small stone sept there would be more now the summer had been long and peaceful north of here the kingsroad ran along the green fork of the trident through fertile valleys and green woodlands past thriving towns and stout holdfasts and the castles of the river lords catelyn knew them all the blackwoods and the brackens ever enemies whose quarrels her father was obliged to settle lady whent last of her line who dwelt with her ghosts in the cavernous vaults of harrenhal irascible lord frey who had outlived seven wives and filled his twin castles with children grandchildren and great grandchildren and bastards and grandbastards as well all of them were bannermen to the tullys their swords sworn to the service of riverrun catelyn wondered if that would be enough if it came to war her father was the staunchest man whod ever lived and she had no doubt that he would call his banners but would the banners come the darrys and rygers and mootons had sworn oaths to riverrun as well yet they had fought with rhaegar targaryen on the trident while lord frey had arrived with his levies well after the battle was over leaving some doubt as to which army he had planned to join theirs he had assured the victors solemnly in the aftermath but ever after her father had called him the late lord frey it must not come to war catelyn thought fervently they must not let it ser rodrik came for her just as the bell ceased its clangor we had best make haste if we hope to eat tonight my lady it might be safer if we were not knight and lady until we pass the neck she told him common travelers attract less notice a father and daughter taken to the road on some family business say as you say my lady ser rodrik agreed it was only when she laughed that he realized what hed done the old courtesies die hard my my daughter he tried to tug on his missing whiskers and sighed with exasperation catelyn took his arm come father she said youll find that masha heddle sets a good table i think but try not to praise her you truly dont want to see her smile the common room was long and drafty with a row of huge wooden kegs at one end and a fireplace at the other a serving boy ran back and forth with skewers of meat while masha drew beer from the kegs chewing her sourleaf all the while the benches were crowded townsfolk and farmers mingling freely with all manner of travelers the crossroads made for odd companions dyers with black and purple hands shared a bench with rivermen reeking of fish an ironsmith thick with muscle squeezed in beside a wizened old septon hard bitten sellswords and soft plump merchants swapped news like boon companions the company included more swords than catelyn would have liked three by the fire wore the red stallion badge of the brackens and there was a large party in blue steel ringmail and capes of a silvery grey on their shoulder was another familiar sigil the twin towers of house frey she studied their faces but they were all too young to have known her the senior among them would have been no older than bran when she went north ser rodrik found them an empty place on the bench near the kitchen across the table a handsome youth was fingering a woodharp seven blessings to you goodfolk he said as they sat an empty wine cup stood on the table before him and to you singer catelyn returned ser rodrik called for bread and meat and beer in a tone that meant now the singer a youth of some eighteen years eyed them boldly and asked where they were going and from whence they had come and what news they had letting the questions fly as quick as arrows and never pausing for an answer we left kings landing a fortnight ago catelyn replied answering the safest of his questions thats where im bound the youth said as she had suspected he was more interested in telling his own story than in hearing theirs singers loved nothing half so well as the sound of their own voices the hands tourney means rich lords with fat purses the last time i came away with more silver than i could carry or would have if i hadnt lost it all betting on the kingslayer to win the day the gods frown on the gambler ser rodrik said sternly he was of the north and shared the stark views on tournaments they frowned on me for certain the singer said your cruel gods and the knight of flowers altogether did me in no doubt that was a lesson for you ser rodrik said it was this time my coin will champion ser loras ser rodrik tried to tug at whiskers that were not there but before he could frame a rebuke the serving boy came scurrying up he laid trenchers of bread before them and filled them with chunks of browned meat off a skewer dripping with hot juice another skewer held tiny onions fire peppers and fat mushrooms ser rodrik set to lustily as the lad ran back to fetch them beer my name is marillion the singer said plucking a string on his woodharp doubtless youve heard me play somewhere his manner made catelyn smile few wandering singers ever ventured as far north as winterfell but she knew his like from her girlhood in riverrun i fear not she told him he drew a plaintive chord from the woodharp that is your loss he said who was the finest singer youve ever heard alia of braavos ser rodrik answered at once oh im much better than that old stick marillion said if you have the silver for a song ill gladly show you i might have a copper or two but id sooner toss it down a well than pay for your howling ser rodrik groused his opinion of singers was well known music was a lovely thing for girls but he could not comprehend why any healthy boy would fill his hand with a harp when he might have had a sword your grandfather has a sour nature marillion said to catelyn i meant to do you honor an homage to your beauty in truth i was made to sing for kings and high lords oh i can see that catelyn said lord tully is fond of song i hear no doubt youve been to riverrun a hundred times the singer said airily they keep a chamber for me and the young lord is like a brother catelyn smiled wondering what edmure would think of that another singer had once bedded a girl her brother fancied he had hated the breed ever since and winterfell she asked him have you traveled north why would it marillion asked its all blizzards and bearskins up there and the starks know no music but the howling of wolves distantly she was aware of the door banging open at the far end of the room innkeep a servants voice called out behind her we have horses that want stabling and my lord of lannister requires a room and a hot bath oh gods ser rodrik said before catelyn reached out to silence him her fingers tightening hard around his forearm masha heddle was bowing and smiling her hideous red smile im sorry mlord truly were full up every room there were four of them catelyn saw an old man in the black of the nights watch two servants and him standing there small and bold as life my men will steep in your stable and as for myself well i do not require a large room as you can plainly see he flashed a mocking grin so long as the fires warm and the straw reasonably free of fleas i am a happy man masha heddle was beside herself mlord theres nothing its the tourney theres no help for it oh tyrion lannister pulled a coin from his purse and flicked it up over his head caught it tossed it again even across the room where catelyn sat the wink of gold was unmistakable a freerider in a faded blue cloak lurched to his feet youre welcome to my room mlord now theres a clever man lannister said as he sent the coin spinning across the room the freerider snatched it from the air and a nimble one to boot the dwarf turned back to masha heddle you will be able to manage food i trust anything you like m ord anything at all the innkeep promised and may he choke on it catelyn thought but it was bran she saw choking drowning on his own blood lannister glanced at the nearest tables my men will have whatever youre serving these people double portions weve had a long hard ride ill take a roast fowl chicken duck pigeon it makes no matter and send up a flagon of your best wine yoren will you sup with me aye m ord i will the black brother replied the dwarf had not so much as glanced toward the far end of the room and catelyn was thinking how grateful she was for the crowded benches between them when suddenly marillion bounded to his feet my lord of lannister he called out i would be pleased to entertain you while you eat let me sing you the lay of your fathers great victory at kings landing nothing would be more likely to ruin my supper the dwarf said dryly his mismatched eyes considered the singer briefly started to move away and found catelyn he looked at her for a moment puzzled she turned her face away but too late the dwarf was smiling lady stark what an unexpected pleasure he said i was sorry to miss you at winterfell marillion gaped at her confusion giving way to chagrin as catelyn rose slowly to her feet she heatd set rodrik curse if only the man had lingered at the wall she thought if only lady stark masha heddle said thickly i was still catelyn tully the last time i bedded here she told the innkeep she could hear the muttering feel the eyes upon her catelyn glanced around the room at the faces of the knights and sworn swords and took a deep breath to slow the frantic beating of her heart did she dare take the risk there was no time to think it through only the moment and the sound of her own voice ringing in her ears you in the corner she said to an older man she had not noticed until now is that the black bat of harrenhal i see embroidered on your surcoat ser the man got to his feet it is my lady and is lady whent a true and honest friend to my father lord hoster tully of riverrun she is the man replied stoutly ser rodrik rose quietly and loosened his sword in its scabbard the dwarf was blinking at them blank faced with puzzlement in his mismatched eyes the red stallion was ever a welcome sight in riverrun she said to the trio by the fire my father counts jonos bracken among his oldest and most loyal bannermen the three men at arms exchanged uncertain looks our lord is honored by his trust one of them said hesitantly i envy your father all these fine friends lannister quipped but i do not quite see the purpose of this lady stark she ignored him turning to the large party in blue and grey they were the heart of the matter there were more than twenty of them i know your sigil as well the twin towers of frey how fares your good lord sers their captain rose lord walder is well my lady he plans to take a new wife on his ninetieth name day and has asked your lord father to honor the wedding with his presence tyrion lannister sniggered that was when catelyn knew he was hers this man came a guest into my house and there conspired to murder my son a boy of seven she proclaimed to the room at large i pointing ser rodrik moved to her side his sword in hand in the name of king robert and the good lords you serve i call upon you to seize him and help me return him to winterfell to await the kings justice she did not know what was more satisfying the sound of a dozen swords drawn as one or the look on tyrion lannisters face sansa sansa rode to the hands tourney with septa mordane and jeyne poole in a litter with curtains of yellow silk so fine she could see right through them they turned the whole world gold beyond the city walls a hundred pavilions had been raised beside the river and the common folk came out in the thousands to watch the games the splendor of it all took sansas breath away the shining armor the great chargers caparisoned in silver and gold the shouts of the crowd the banners snapping in the wind and the knights themselves the knights most of all it is better than the songs she whispered when they found the places that her father had promised her among the high lords and ladies sansa was dressed beautifully that day in a green gown that brought out the auburn of her hair and she knew they were looking at her and smiling they watched the heroes of a hundred songs ride forth each more fabulous than the last the seven knights of the kingsguard took the field all but jaime lannister in scaled armor the color of milk their cloaks as white as freshfallen snow ser jaime wore the white cloak as well but beneath it he was shining gold from head to foot with a lionshead helm and a golden sword ser gregor clegane the mountain that rides thundered past them like an avalanche sansa remembered lord yohn royce who had guested at winterfell two years glorgl r r martin before his armor is bronze thousands and thousands of years old engraved with magic runes that ward him against harm she whispered to jeyne septa mordane pointed out lord jason mallister in indigo chased with silver the wings of an eagle on his helm he had cut down three of rhaegars bannermen on the trident the girls giggled over the warrior priest thoros of myr with his flapping red robes and shaven head until the septa told them that he had once scaled the walls of pyke with a flaming sword in hand other riders sansa did not know hedge knights from the fingers and highgarden and the mountains of dorne unsung freeriders and new made squires the younger sons of high lords and the heirs of lesser houses younger men most had done no great deeds as yet but sansa and jeyne agreed that one day the seven kingdoms would resound to the sound of their names ser balon swann lord bryce caron of the marches bronze yohns heir ser andar royce and his younger brother ser robar their silvered steel plate filigreed in bronze with the same ancient runes that warded their father the twins ser horas and ser hobber whose shields displayed the grape cluster sigil of the redwynes burgundy on blue patrek mallister lord jasons son six freys of the crossing ser jared ser hosteen ser danwell ser emmon ser theo ser perwyn sons and grandsons of old lord walder frey and his bastard son martyn rivers as well jeyne poole confessed herself frightened by the look of jalabhar xho an exile prince from the summer isles who wore a cape of green and scarlet feathers over skin as dark as night but when she saw young lord beric dondarrion with his hair like red gold and his black shield slashed by lightning she pronounced herself willing to marry him on the instant the hound entered the lists as well and so too the kings brother handsome lord renly of storms end jory alyn and harwin rode for winterfell and the north jory looks a beggar among these others septa mordane sniffed when he appeared sansa could only agree jorys armor was blue grey plate without device or ornament and a thin grey cloak hung from his shoulders like a soiled rag yet he acquitted himself well unhorsing horas redwyne in his first joust and one of the freys in his second in his third match he rode three passes at a freerider named lothor brune whose armor was as drab as his own neither man lost his seat but brunes lance was steadier and his blows better placed and the king gave him the victory alyn and harwin fared less well harwin was unhorsed in his first tilt by ser meryn of the kingsguard while alyn fell to ser balon swann the jousting went all day and into the dusk the hooves of the great warhorses pounding down the lists until the field was a ragged wasteland of torn earth a dozen times jeyne and sansa cried out in unison as riders crashed together lances exploding into splinters while the commons screamed for their favorites jeyne covered her eyes whenever a man fell like a frightened little girl but sansa was made of sterner stuff a great lady knew how to behave at tournaments even septa mordane noted her composure and nodded in approval the kingslayer rode brilliantly he overthrew ser andar royce and the marcher lord bryce caron as easily as if he were riding at rings and then took a hard fought match from white haired barristan selmy who had won his first two tilts against men thirty and forty years his junior sandor clegane and his immense brother ser gregor the mountain seemed unstoppable as well riding down one foe after the next in ferocious style the most terrifying moment of the day came during ser gregors second joust when his lance rode up and struck a young knight from the vale under the gorget with such force that it drove through his throat killing him instantly the youth fell not ten feet from where sansa was seated the point of ser gregors lance had snapped off in his neck and his lifes blood flowed out in slow pulses each weaker than the one before his armor was shiny new a bright streak of fire ran down his outstretched arm as the steel caught the light then the sun went behind a cloud and it was gone his cloak was blue the color of the sky on a clear summers day trimmed with a border of crescent moons but as his blood seeped into it the cloth darkened and the moons turned red one by one jeyne poole wept so hysterically that septa mordane finally took her off to regain her composure but sansa sat with her hands folded in her lap watching with a strange fascination she had never seen a man die before she ought to be crying too she thought but the tears would not come perhaps she had used up all her tears for lady and bran it would be different if it had been jory or ser rodrik or father she told herself the young knight in the blue cloak was nothing to her some stranger from the vale of arryn whose name she had forgotten as soon as she heard it and now the world would forget his name too sansa realized there would be no songs sung for him that was sad after they carried off the body a boy with a spade ran onto the field and shoveled dirt over the spot where he had fallen to cover up the blood then the jousts resumed ser balon swann also fell to gregor and lord renly to the hound renly was unhorsed so violently that he seemed to fly backward off his charger legs in the air his head hit the ground with an audible crack that made the crowd gasp but it was just the golden antler on his helm one of the tines had snapped off beneath him when lord renly climbed to his feet the commons cheered wildly for king roberts handsome young brother was a great favorite he handed the broken tine to his conqueror with a gracious bow the hound snorted and tossed the broken antler into the crowd where the commons began to punch and claw over the little bit of gold until lord renly walked out among them and restored the peace by then septa mordane had returned alone jeyne had been feeling ill she explained she had helped her back to the castle sansa had almost forgotten about jeyne later a hedge knight in a checkered cloak disgraced himself by killing beric dondarrions horse and was declared forfeit lord beric shifted his saddle to a new mount only to be knocked right off it by thoros of myr ser aron santagar and lothor brune tilted thrice without result ser aron fell afterward to lord jason mallister and brune to yohn royces younger son robar in the end it came down to four the hound and his monstrous brother gregor jaime lannister the kingslayer and ser loras tyrell the youth they called the knight of flowers ser loras was the youngest son of mace tyrell the lord of highgarden and warden of the south at sixteen he was the youngest rider on the field yet he had unhorsed three knights of the kingsguard that morning in his first three jousts sansa had never seen anyone so beautiful his plate was intricately fashioned and enameled as a bouquet of a thousand different flowers and his snow white stallion was draped in a blanket of red and white roses after each victory ser loras would remove his helm and ride slowly round the fence and finally pluck a single white rose from the blanket and toss it to some fair maiden in the crowd his last match of the day was against the younger royce ser robars ancestral runes proved small protection as ser loras split his shield and drove him from his saddle to crash with an awful clangor in the dirt robar lay moaning as the victor made his circuit of the field finally they called for a litter and carried him off to his tent dazed and unmoving sansa never saw it her eyes were only for ser loras when the white horse stopped in front of her she thought her heart would burst to the other maidens he had given white roses but the one he plucked for her was red sweet lady he said no victory is half so beautiful as you sansa took the flower timidly struck dumb by his gallantry his hair was a mass of lazy brown curls his eyes like liquid gold she inhaled the sweet fragrance of the rose and sat clutching it long after ser loras had ridden off when sansa finally looked up a man was standing over her staring he was short with a pointed beard and a silver streak in his hair almost as old as her father you must be one of her daughters he said to her he had grey green eyes that did not smile when his mouth did you have the tully look im sansa stark she said ill at ease the man wore a heavy cloak with a fur collar fastened with a silver mockingbird and he had the effortless manner of a high lord but she did not know him i have not had the honor my lord septa mordane quickly took a hand sweet child this is lord petyr baelish of the kings small council your mother was my queen of beauty once the man said quietly his breath smelled of mint you have her hair his fingers brushed against her cheek as he stroked one auburn lock quite abruptly he turned and walked away by then the moon was well up and the crowd was tired so the king decreed that the last three matches would be fought the next morning before the melee while the commons began their walk home talking of the days jousts and the matches to come on the morrow the court moved to the riverside to begin the feast six monstrous huge aurochs had been roasting for hours turning slowly on wooden spits while kitchen boys basted them with butter and herbs until the meat crackled and spit tables and benches had been raised outside the pavilions piled high with sweetgrass and strawberries and fresh baked bread sansa and septa mordane were given places of high honor to the left of the raised dais where the king himself sat beside his queen when prince joffrey seated himself to her right she felt her throat tighten he had not spoken a word to her since the awful thing had happened and she had not dared to speak to him at first she thought she hated him for what theyd done to lady but after sansa had wept her eyes dry she told herself that it had not been joffreys doing not truly the queen had done it she was the one to hate her and arya nothing bad would have happened except for arya she could not hate joffrey tonight he was too beautiful to hate he wore a deep blue doublet studded with a double row of golden lions heads and around his brow a slim coronet made of gold and sapphires his hair was as bright as the metal sansa looked at him and trembled afraid that he might ignore her or worse turn hateful again and send her weeping from the table instead joffrey smiled and kissed her hand handsome and gallant as any prince in the songs and said ser loras has a keen eye for beauty sweet lady he was too kind she demurred trying to remain modest and calm though her heart was singing ser loras is a true knight do you think he will win tomorrow my lord no jofftey said my dog will do for him or perhaps my uncle jaime and in a few years when i am old enough to enter the lists i shall do for them all he raised his hand to summon a servant with a flagon of iced surnmerwine and poured her a cup she looked anxiously at septa mordane until jofftey leaned over and filled the septas cup as well so she nodded and thanked him graciously and said not another word the servants kept the cups filled all night yet afterward sansa could not recall ever tasting the wine she needed no wine she was drunk on the magic of the night giddy with glamour swept away by beauties she had dreamt of all her life and never dared hope to know singers sat before the kings pavilion filling the dusk with music a juggler kept a cascade of burning clubs spinning through the air the kings own fool the pie faced simpleton called moon boy danced about on stilts all in motley making mock of everyone with such deft cruelty that sansa wondered if he was simple after all even septa mordane was helpless before him when he sang his little song about the high septon she laughed so hard she spilled wine on herself and joffrey was the soul of courtesy he talked to sansa all night showering her with compliments making her laugh sharing little bits of court gossip explaining moon boys japes sansa was so captivated that she quite forgot all her courtesies and ignored septa mordane seated to her left all the while the courses came and went a thick soup of barley and venison salads of sweetgrass and spinach and plums sprinkled with crushed nuts snails in honey and garlic sansa had never eaten snails before jofftey showed her how to get the snail out of the shell and fed her the first sweet morsel himself then came trout fresh from the river baked in clay her prince helped her crack open the hard casing to expose the flaky white flesh within and when the meat course was brought out he served her himself slicing a queens portion from the joint smiling as he laid it on her plate she could see from the way he moved that his right arm was still troubling him yet he uttered not a word of complaint later came sweetbreads and pigeon pie and baked apples fragrant with cinnamon and lemon cakes frosted in sugar but by then sansa was so stuffed that she could not manage more than two little lemon cakes as much as she loved them she was wondering whether she might attempt a third when the king began to shout king robert had grown louder with each course from time to time sansa could hear him laughing or roaring a command over the music and the clangor of plates and cutlery but they were too far away for her to make out his words now everybody heard him no he thundered in a voice that drowned out all other speech sansa was shocked to see the king on his feet red of face reeling he had a goblet of wine in one hand and he was drunk as a man could be you do not tell me what to do woman he screamed at queen cersei i am king here do you understand i rule here and if i say that i will fight tomorrow i will fight everyone was staring sansa saw ser barristan and the kings brother renly and the short man who had talked to her so oddly and touched her hair but no one made a move to interfere the queens face was a mask so bloodless that it might have been sculpted from snow she rose from the table gathered her skirts around her and stormed off in silence servants trailing behind jaime lannister put a hand on the kings shoulder but the king shoved him away hard lannister stumbled and fell the king guffawed the great knight i can still knock you in the dirt remember that kingslayer he slapped his chest with the jeweled goblet splashing wine all over his satin tunic give me my hammer and not a man in the realm can stand before me jaime lannister rose and brushed himself off as you say your grace his voice was stiff lord renly came forward smiling youve spilled your wine robert let me bring you a fresh goblet sansa started as joffrey laid his hand on her arm it grows late the prince said he had a queer look on his face as if he were not seeing her at all do you need an escort back to the castle no sansa began she looked for septa mordane and was startled to find her with her head on the table snoring soft and ladylike snores i mean to say yes thank you that would be most kind i am tired and the way is so dark i should be glad for some protection joffrey called out dog sandor clegane seemed to take form out of the night so quickly did he appear he had exchanged his armor for a red woolen tunic with a leather dogs head sewn on the front the light of the torches made his burned face shine a dull red yes your grace he said take my betrothed back to the castle and see that no harm befalls her the prince told him brusquely and without even a word of farewell joffrey strode off leaving her there sansa could feel the hound watching her did you think joff was going to take you himself he laughed he had a laugh like the snarling of dogs in a pit small chance of that he pulled her unresisting to her feet come youre not the only one needs sleep ive drunk too much and i may need to kill my brother tomorrow he laughed again suddenly terrified sansa pushed at septa mordanes shoulder hoping to wake her but she only snored the louder king robert had stumbled off and half the benches were suddenly empty the feast was over and the beautiful dream had ended with it the hound snatched up a torch to light their way sansa followed close beside him the ground was rocky and uneven the flickering light made it seem to shift and move beneath her she kept her eyes lowered watching where she placed her feet they walked among the pavilions each with its banner and its armor hung outside the silence weighing heavier with every step sansa could not bear the sight of him he frightened her so yet she had been raised in all the ways of courtesy a true lady would not notice his face she told herself you rode gallantly today ser sandor she made herself say sandor clegane snarled at her spare me your empty little compliments girl and your sers i am no knight i spit on them and their vows my brother is a knight did you see him ride today yes sansa whispered trembling he was gallant the hound finished he was mocking her she realized no one could withstand him she managed at last proud of herself it was no lie sandor clegane stopped suddenly in the middle of a dark and empty field she had no choice but to stop beside him some septa trained you well youre like one of those birds from the summer isles arent you a pretty little talking bird repeating all the pretty little words they taught you to recite thats unkind sansa could feel her heart fluttering in her chest youre frightening me i want to go now no one could withstand him the hound rasped thats truth enough no one could ever withstand gregor that boy today his second joust oh that was a pretty bit of business you saw that did you fool boy he had no business riding in this company no money no squire no one to help him with that armor that gorget wasnt fastened proper you think gregor didnt notice that you think ser gregors lance rode up by chance do you pretty little talking girl you believe that youre empty headed as a bird for true gregors lance goes where gregor wants it to go look at me look at me sandor clegane put a huge hand under her chin and forced her face up he squatted in front of her and moved the torch close theres a pretty for you take a good long stare you know you want to ive watched you turning away all the way down the kingsroad piss on that take your look his fingers held her jaw as hard as an iron trap his eyes watched hers drunken eyes sullen with anger she had to look the right side of his face was gaunt with sharp cheekbones and a grey eye beneath a heavy brow his nose was large and hooked his hair thin dark he wore it long and brushed it sideways because no hair grew on the other side of that face the left side of his face was a ruin his ear had been burned away there was nothing left but a hole his eye was still good but all around it was a twisted mass of scar slick black flesh hard as leather pocked with craters and fissured by deep cracks that gleamed red and wet when he moved down by his jaw you could see a hint of bone where the flesh had been seared away sansa began to cry he let go of her then and snuffed out the torch in the dirt no pretty words for that girl no little compliment the septa taught you when there was no answer he continued most of them they think it was some battle a siege a burning tower an enemy with a torch one fool asked if it was dragonsbreath his laugh was softer this time but just as bitter ill tell you what it was girl he said a voice from the night a shadow leaning so close now that she could smell the sour stench of wine on his breath i was younger than you six maybe seven a woodcarver set up shop in the village under my fathers keep and to buy favor he sent us gifts the old man made marvelous toys i dont remember what i got but it was gregors gift i wanted a wooden knight all painted up every joint pegged separate and fixed with strings so you could make him fight gregor is five years older than me the toy was nothing to him he was already a squire near six foot tall and muscled like an ox so i took his knight but there was no joy to it i tell you i was scared all the while and true enough he found me there was a brazier in the room gregor never said a word just picked me up under his arm and shoved the side of my face down in the burning coals and held me there while i screamed and screamed you saw how strong he is even then it took three grown men to drag him off me the septons preach about the seven hells what do they know only a man whos been burned knows what hell is truly like'"
